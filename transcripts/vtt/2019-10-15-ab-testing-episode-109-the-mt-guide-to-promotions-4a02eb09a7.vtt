00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.820
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey Britt hey Alan back

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.800
again aren't we we are after a little bit of a delay I hate technology

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.470
technology blows whatever just got a new I got some more home decided to go all

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.630
in on Google got like some nest stuff to replace my old nest stuff from the old

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.990
house which which nest stuff got a lot about I got the desk doorbell I got the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.990
nest locked to replace my old ring and thermostat thermostat of course yeah

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.580
because I can't even I'm too stupid now I can't make a normal thermostat work and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.100
why should we have to we shouldn't have to so and of course I can control it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.380
off my phone so that's cool until I until it screws up and I just thought I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:19.130
hate technology again yeah I don't see that happening so anyway I haven't put

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.090
it's in a box on my you ever used it did you use it on your last house no I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.250
had a different lock but this one's cool cuz I can tell if I remembered to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.820
lock the house but I anyway I'll let you know you'd please do like this got

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.890
a box of crap so I'm all in on the Google hardware stuff I've got two of the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.030
mini speakers I've got one of the tablet minis speaker thingies forget what

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.150
they call it the the only thing I'm disappointed with is so as we talked

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.630
about last time I have the new refrigerator it's a Samsung one it's got

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.900
a huge friggin else or LCD panel on it or touchscreen panel on it but its voice

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.940
control is Bixby oh and I can't stand Bixby yeah I it's on my phone of course

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.100
I was Samsung phone but I don't use it I don't either I don't know anyone that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.380
does apparently in the in the Samsung 10 you have the option of disabling it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.540
and replacing it right it really I hear I have a galaxy 10 I haven't figured it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.780
out you have a 10 oh my I'm on there are apps to remap the Bixby button yeah but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.300
Samsung used to keep releasing every time someone found a way to remap it yeah

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.820
they would release a new thing that anyway what I can't stand is I can't

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.420
stand saying hi Bixby like the name Bixby just doesn't roll for me I'm gonna

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.100
call you that now Bixby yeah yeah so speaking of come highly related or

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.900
partially related highly more political you made the comment that Samsung wanted

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.420
to block people from using the button to disable it you're aware of the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:18.290
controversy with Blizzard Blizzard no so Blizzard banned a user for being all

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.650
up in that and I forget exactly what he did or said but they banned him and for

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.620
being pro Hong Kong yes and but so many people were leading their accounts in

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.660
protest that they removed all foot they made it virtually impossible for

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.980
people to remove their accounts to delete their accounts they took out the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.860
like they disabled I I I haven't disabled mine because I haven't used my

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.260
blizzard account in years maybe decade but I was reading on the internet which

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.940
is always a source of good information sometimes that they were that people

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.100
were unable to delete their accounts because there are four different ways

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:15.360
they could do it and they were all disabled in some way okay so I don't

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.960
understand that strategy how does that help because the thing I would do next

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:30.080
is I would go to PayPal or go to my credit card company like if and just

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.140
disable it there I would just cancel it right no I don't care if they ask for

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.860
auto-pay do not send them money I don't know if a lot of people would figure

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.130
that out yeah man so we got some stuff to talk about got a little bit

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.970
of a late start and so we should probably get going what do you think

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.290
yo yeah yeah I actually I didn't I didn't realize that that's how blizzard

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.730
responded so I love you should go look into that I love this not anymore man

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.130
you're gonna burn that shit I love the star craft franchise but yeah that's

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:14.690
that's a bunch of crap yeah so and there's lots of stuff it's weird

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.410
lots of stuff happening in the world showing should we go in order and get

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.010
going do the order order on the order of the things on the board I was gonna say

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.130
what do you want to jump around take a big McMuffin there was more stuff on

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.290
the list I gave you but let's just start with that so we've been doing a I

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.120
was chatting with Brett yesterday about our topics for today we were in our

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.680
planning meeting yes planning meeting over slack I said what do you have

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.680
for tomorrow right so I got nothing I said okay here's some further I didn't

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.680
even realize that we were recording yet today he looked in his bag of nothing and

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.040
there wasn't even a calendar reminder no there was I mean nothing so I don't

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.200
remember what was on the list or how we got there let's go ahead and start

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.680
with what you put on the board which is a a vagary a variation of that

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.840
recently for those of you that don't know maybe new listeners I work at

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.920
Unity technologies making game development software that is not recent

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.240
and I've been there for almost three years before that it by the way that is

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:29.400
an Allen record no no no remember I'm not in the same job I was hired to do I

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:38.500
take that back so yeah two years Brett used to say this I said no no that's

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.980
not right but in hindsight he was exactly right because I tend to stay in a

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.860
job for two years and and maybe this is not a tangent this is very modern

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.500
testinings what happened is modern testinish testinish testing ish got it

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.700
it's really it's empty adjacent by the way if you have modern testing stories

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.860
please ping me because I'm giving a talk next month where I'm sharing modern

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.420
testing stories and so far I have to to share which are awesome and I want to

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.100
this is tangent inception I'm sorry I wanted to thank you know Lisa Crispin

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.460
author of agile testing and a pure famous an awesome person who listens to

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.130
the podcast has been so supportive I really I'm humbled because she promotes

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.930
the show and supports the show and is a just a big supporter which is really

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.730
cool because she's done she and Janet Gregory with agile testing and the stuff

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.890
she's done on her own they've done some cool stuff so that's that's pretty

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.210
awesome but she gave me a story about modern testing that I'm going to share at

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.570
this talk next month at or a dev but she got a co-worker also at Mabel

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.420
different department entirely to write up with graphics and everything which I

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.180
will use his own story about how he's using modern testing so I'm great two

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.420
awesome stories different same company different aspects of the company and

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.260
different approaches but super cool looking for more but just really

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.890
appreciate the support from all three listeners are you looking for a complete

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.730
empty story or or people who are using the principles to make their lives

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.530
yes that one that one oh we should have a ton of those on the three yeah

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:33.250
yeah yeah yeah I hope so yeah and there's one I'll probably dig one out of

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.210
I have some other conversations I've had where I've asked some people who have

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.530
we're kind of doing modern testing before we put a name to it and assign

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:48.090
principles to it so we can dig up I mean there's a lot of those type of

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:54.810
stories here at Microsoft right I have your last your last you have your last

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:04.270
team at unity right um so send them my way but I think something not us is yeah

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:09.030
yeah you can comment on the blog you can email me Alan at angry weasel calm

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.670
just let me know if you have those stories I'm glad to get those from you

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.970
like you can mail them to me I can talk to you on zoom we begin to get them

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:21.790
verbatim but anyway I brought that up changing jobs because I worked myself

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.890
out of the job I was hired to do at unity which is also reflecting is

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.770
something I've not the first time I've done that it's become a habit with me and

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:38.930
I don't know why I do it but it's just it's like it's some negative I you're

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.770
right right I think some people would see it as negative but that's sort of

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.730
the way I do things I try I optimize what I the tasks I was given or the

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.740
goals I was given until I'm no longer needed so I did that my last job at unity

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:59.140
have a new job which again took me about just like the first one about two months

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.800
in I figured out what the long-term path was it'll take a while how to make

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.660
my how to eliminate the need for my why why not my job 16 months well I've

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.980
been there since April May June so you got your left I've been if I've been in

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.620
this group almost six months so I'm about a year and a half left to make my job

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:27.400
obsolete okay and what I imagine is within the next six months my job will

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.300
morph and then it might reset that timeline but we'll see we'll keep in

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.900
touch so one of the things I've been involved with recently and one of the

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.820
things I was involved with even at a much deeper level at Microsoft were

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.660
something at Microsoft originally called ladder levels then called career stage

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.820
profiles then called career guides a lot of companies called career maps and we

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.700
called job architecture and what it is is and everyone's seen this if not

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:08.140
there are numerous examples on the internet a grid a matrix of

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:15.180
descriptions that describe what people do at a company at different levels of

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.140
career advancement or development and usually they give these names at

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:25.500
Microsoft you are a you are an SDE one then an SDE two then a senior then a

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.700
principal then a partner then a fellow then a whatever it's been interesting

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.620
I'm gonna kick this off I'm gonna go back to you say you have some strong

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:39.340
opinions on this but right now I'm trying to roll my eyes so hard they've

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.500
actually turned 360 it's really creepy they've come all the way back around I

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.220
didn't know eyes could do that yes I'm trying to make sure it comes across on

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.580
the podcast so let me be so there are pros and cons and I was able to meet

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.340
with one of our HR directors before I started at Unity and they were talking

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.380
about this process of they wanted to build do something like this and I

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.460
gave them all the warning so here's the challenge here's the balance we you

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.700
need to deal with the companies that have this one you absolutely need to

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.100
provide some guidance to managers and employees on how people can grow their

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.420
career and advance and get better and provide more value to the company

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:26.020
however it is a fine line between that and creating a culture where people only

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:33.280
worry about being promoted and I see it's it's like in the horror movie when

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.600
you start to see the flashes of the dark side like pop through go go away maybe

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.280
if I ignore it it will happen again there's some worry in some parts of the

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.440
company when I talk to people about this I think it's it's a difficult it's

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.960
a difficult thing to navigate I think it's more of a managerial problem than

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.640
an employee problem and a leadership problem than an employee problem but we

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.360
can all take part to try to make sure it's really easy to go to the dark side

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.720
and I'm gonna stop there and as a Brent eyes are actually spinning backward he

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.640
looks like a reverse slot machine I'm hoping they come up cherries anyway I'm

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.040
gonna shut up and let Brent talk about his thoughts on this for all before I

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:27.200
go any deeper all right so here's the first thing good I wouldn't want you to

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.720
start with the second or third thing awesome okay now I'm starting with the

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:39.670
third thing no I'm not first thing okay when you put in these sort of

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.580
structures you got to think you think about the good and the bad and that's

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:51.540
that's what you're doing okay but any tool just like automation co-coverage

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:58.420
example any tool that can be used for good can be used for evil and will be

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:13.740
indeed now there is something it happens quite often at least here at Microsoft

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:21.920
when it comes to promotions this is all limited by budget every company will have

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.120
a budget that they allocate to it I don't know how unity does that but we have

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.120
a budget guarantee you have a budget right that's one of the things it's

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.480
very similar there's a budget and you're expected to be thin the budget and yeah

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:51.450
yeah so here's one trick that companies will use and be very wary of it in the

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:58.660
end that is they will frame it totally in the positive oh we need to have a way to

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:06.060
set a career path so that people can get promoted when it comes to budget for

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.860
example oh we want to differentiate our top reward people so you know 9% or 10%

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:19.660
now my eyes are rolling 10% of all of you of your people need to be in the

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:25.940
top rewards so that sort of behavior that even more than even having the

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.300
the models there in the first place is what encourages people to focus on

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.140
being promoted focus on trying to get in that top percent versus doing the

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.780
right thing for the customer if our priority I'm attached to modern testing

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.860
our priority is improving the business our priority is not freaking getting

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:53.620
promoted well so there's two businesses in play so we'll talk this out again

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.460
alright because I'm now I'm getting boilie here I'm taking my jacket off

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.060
yeah so let me first close on on why I was bringing up that that top 10%

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:12.570
budget okay now I don't have enough knowledge of how other companies do this

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:24.510
but here as you go into different tiers the rewards is nonlinear yes okay so when

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:33.300
they push a model that says top 10% and you have a limited budget what does

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:39.940
that force to happen you give your top 10% to the people lower in levels because

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:50.390
they take less of your budget yep and that's that's for sure one thing that

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.590
happens until they until they say oh and you have to do it by band or something

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.180
silly like that I'm sure that's the next thing that they'll say but what it

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:08.380
does is it forces you to take a huge chunk of your budget and distribute that

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.060
and a lot of the times this is my biggest problem with that it creates a

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.340
hero culture mm-hmm okay because what in order to let's say I had to raise

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.900
Brent let's say I had 10 people and I had to do 10% that meant one of my

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:31.020
person people had to be all the way to the top okay in order to pay for that I

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:40.220
have to put everyone else below average right even if they are yeah and even if

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:47.300
they aren't now what happens though when you do that is it is it creates a

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.140
culture of that one person versus the rest of the team it creates and this is

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.420
my one of the biggest reasons I left Microsoft is and and anyway in any of

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.260
the flashes I've seen none of this bad there have been there are no

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:06.310
inclinations at my current company to do any sort of rewarding like this we try

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.660
and reward fairly we have a pretty decent budget do it and we but anyway

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.860
this culture of competition where it's not about the hero doesn't give a crap

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.590
about the customer the hero the hero is the hero is concerned with being a hero

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:29.500
and my last I've thrown one of the bus before the last group I worked in a

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:36.690
Microsoft team so it's hands down the worst at this stuff the most I think

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.650
toxic gets thrown around a lot as a word so I won't call it toxic I'm gonna say

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:47.490
the words what's in your head toxic but it was an unhealthy culture where

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:53.210
people were far more concerned about promotions and looking good and getting

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:58.450
into those top reward bands than they were about actually doing the right

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.290
thing for the customer and it just drove me batty I love the times the

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.930
reason why you see that as well as this is a defensive action like the only way

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:12.450
to make sure you don't get a bad review is to play this game and and compete to

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:18.350
get a good one yep right so a lot of folks are just trying to avoid pain I

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:24.130
have to do this because if I get another bad review I'll lose my job

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:31.450
there are two businesses involved when it comes to promotions right there is the

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:39.340
business that employs you and there's also the your personal business off for

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.700
example here if I were guiding you I would say you need to consider the

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:59.540
business of Alan right you have a right to to get the best pay you you can right

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:06.710
and but not here I'm saying on the open market like your skills are sellable like

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:14.250
it you this is taking a pure economic point of view we talked about pink many

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.730
times like that is that is not always appropriate and most often absolutely not

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:28.470
but let's imagine let's say it's it's a year and a half from now you've yet

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.310
again succeeded in automating yourself out of a job but this time there's no

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:37.300
home for you and you're like you know what I'm ancient you know I've always

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:47.130
wanted to do this nonprofit consulting gig right but doing that you're gonna go

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:53.930
to 50k a year right now if you love what you're doing enough maybe that's worth

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.050
it so this is a good and relevant example because as I don't have a

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.250
wrench in on air but I will spend three years I can do it now I took a

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:09.720
definite total comp pay cut to go to unity and I have not once reg even

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.040
watching the Microsoft stock go up I haven't once regretted it because it's

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:21.920
the the exponential improvement in mental health and quality of life means a lot

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.040
more so pink is exactly right pay people enough and I get paid enough where

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.120
money is not an issue I'm paid well I'm paid enough that money isn't an issue

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:38.970
and I don't focus on and maybe this maybe this ruins my own career development

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.150
right don't focus on getting promoted I just wanted I want to help people I

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.950
want to do the right things I believe in servant leadership I want to provide a

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:51.610
service for our organization and I like doing that so there is a balance so what

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.970
I saw at Microsoft and Whitaker and I used to talk about this extensively

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:05.600
where we would see people in we would see people in Peter principle there and what

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.280
happens is your value and you know this happens there are people at Microsoft

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.080
whose value to the company is far more than their value on the open market

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.880
and Whitaker used to joke that we should have all these all partners and

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.440
maybe it was Dan Masi who came up with this now I can't remember but it doesn't

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.620
matter we had the notion that people a partner level and above which is the high

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.660
bonus high stock level Microsoft all those people should have to interview

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.820
for an external job once every two years and show an offer that shows that

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.500
they're actually worth that money and the argument is the one I just made

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.060
those people are more valuable out internally to Microsoft than they are

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:55.310
externally to Microsoft so it the idea that while the notion was fun to talk

00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:01.170
about it would never work but I'll ask you how do you deal with I mean what's

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.010
the so you have someone in a role who's been who's played this game forever to a

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.610
level where they are paid more than their worth but they're still playing

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.690
this game and I want to get back on the track of levels again in a minute

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.370
but yeah now I'm talking about things that pissed me off about Microsoft I

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.930
don't have a good answer for that one right maybe it's out of our hands it's

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:29.180
just something that happens it I'm sure it happens at every company that the so in

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:40.390
2010 the Nobel Prize winners for on the topic of management science I had no

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.670
idea there was a Nobel Prize for management science yeah today I

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:54.270
learned they got the prize because they proved that Peter principle exists and

00:23:54.270 --> 00:24:03.820
works so do you know why we have the bell curve the bell curve strategy for

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.780
promotions and incentives I thought it was something we borrowed that came from

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.020
Welch it did and did Welch get it from somewhere else but it is the best

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.560
known defense to the pre-d

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:25.290
principle that is why most companies do it because people get promoted to the

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:33.730
point of incompetence and that bell curve is the only tool are the best known

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:40.990
tool to get those people now that they're incompetent out but you and I

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.070
both know there are incompetent people in very senior positions at Microsoft

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:52.860
who are still employed what happened there's politicians exist everywhere and

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:59.920
that's actually you're right it's actually a very good answer and and by

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.730
the way the let's say let's say you were back at Microsoft and you happen to

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:11.700
be one of those people the way you deal with with it like your defense

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:20.320
against the bell curve is that you you become pro you become very supportive

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:27.410
of people moving into your band whose output would be lower than you I I

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:33.450
watched this I won't name any names because I think they're both still

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.810
employed are all still employed at Microsoft but in my last group I had a

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.850
friend a good friend who was a partner level which is as I mentioned when

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:48.430
you're out of the room a very senior level while they weren't looking to fire

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:55.780
removed from duty anyone their awards are still spread out across the people

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:01.820
in that band and his goal was to says all I have to do is be better than person

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:10.060
a yep and it was a low bar yes you just had to make sure you're not the one

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:19.020
on the bottom now I will share with you what my ideal strategy would be okay and

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:25.720
I will also tell you I have no idea how to implement this yep but the ideal

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.820
strategy because companies they want to make sure that they are paying people

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:37.840
enough to be competitive right they don't want to they don't want other

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:44.110
companies to pull people wages on the purposes of money but it's a full package

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:51.950
right yes money can go down in your company the more your company creates a

00:26:51.950 --> 00:27:01.720
very vibrant and genuine employee engagement practice policies right if

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:12.030
people people who are happy need to get paid less I mean it's not a directive

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:17.960
but they need the money less because they're willing to trade off much like

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:23.400
you just said right all right let me go into my my first thing on on ladder

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.760
levels yeah and again let's shift let's talk about ladder levels rather and

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.360
well yeah we it was a necessary not even a tangent a discussion but go ahead

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:44.620
so first off I guess I'll talk one last closing but on on promotion there are two

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:54.700
ways to get promoted that I've noticed there it actually is it really is just

00:27:54.700 --> 00:28:03.740
one way to get promoted you have to add the perception of consistent results okay

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:12.160
and I have seen many people get I'm gonna let you fit I'm gonna let you finish you

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:18.690
want to tweak it or you want to push back I think that's go ahead and go on I

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:24.540
think that's not necessarily universally true I don't know if it I don't know if

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:32.040
it is but there is there's okay so if I actually I'm gonna push back so can you

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.600
said you want to get promoting you have consistent results the perception of

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:46.620
consistent results okay so but as being so I'm a I'm a entry-level dev yep and I

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:52.400
write code and I write unit tests for my code and my coach and I deploy my code

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.640
and I really take on any new big things don't try harder things but I just do

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.320
that and I'm consistent I consistently check in code that has tests and which

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.810
is so I'm not horrible if I do that consistently I should get promoted okay

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:15.580
now you're being pedantic I am that the that's my that's my middle name okay

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:21.820
then let me add an adjective okay the perception of consistent exceptional

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:30.140
results oh that's completely different yes go on okay thank you now notice how

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:37.620
I said in every time I defined it I said the word perception because it is in

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:45.580
fact a very successful promotion strategy that all you have to do is get people

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.020
to believe you've delivered it and actually delivering it is entirely

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.940
irrelevant so you're in the political side of getting promoted which is yes

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:01.410
and which again drives me crazy it absolutely drives me crazy it getting

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:08.850
promoted shouldn't be a marketing spiel or a political rally no all right so my

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:21.610
ideal strategy would be we have some magic means to know that every company

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:28.370
has some magic means to know how much profit they are making off of an

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:35.050
individual that's very difficult it would be and then I would that should

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:40.390
never happen my role is entirely intangible so I do not want that well

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:46.750
even the value my unity to value is somewhere between zero and ten million

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:53.690
dollars somewhere between there well no so folks in an influence role actually

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.330
actually that makes it even harder I'm gonna I'm gonna rephrase that my value

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:03.370
to unity is somewhere between negative my salary to a million dollars

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:12.760
somewhere in there okay I could be just a total net loss so but if there were a

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:23.060
way to to actually measure your value and such that you could have say near

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:31.400
real-time visibility to it then you would learn and you would adjust and you

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:37.880
would be able to go oh okay yeah so I spent six months on this thing where I

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:44.600
did I see if I go focus on this thing my value to the company boots but that

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.560
let's let's stay out of the theoretical game so let me know I'm gonna cuz I'm

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.880
I want to push back it so I I want to see how you do recall that I said this

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.280
doesn't exist right yeah okay but but I want to add one more thing so way back

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:08.820
20 plus years ago 25 years ago holy crap somewhere back there I wrote this front

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.700
page was this web development tool that Microsoft acquired it caused some bad

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:18.060
things to happen I work working on ie 2 or ie 3 I can't remember and I wrote a

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:25.740
translation tool to help people migrate their their websites or static websites

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.420
from the crappy front page output to something that would actually be web

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.740
standard compliant and it saved accounts it saved millions of dollars all

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.860
on my $40,000 a year salary at the time should I have gotten that should I've

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.540
been gotten paid a million dollars that year I don't know okay go on I'm

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:50.980
gonna be quiet at least 30 seconds and I again I admit this is idealistic and

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.380
there would be a lot of details to be worked out and they haven't been

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.300
because again I don't even know where to begin to start measuring this but

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:09.260
an ideal situation is at every annual review your salary is adjusted such that

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:18.350
the company continues to make the expected amount of profit off of you so

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:24.340
if you do something fantastic your salary goes up because they are expecting

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:35.390
okay this guy is a influencer but you're in a super high role and you know

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:41.990
you start doing the skating thing yeah your salary tanks that's the biggest

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:49.110
issue I see once you get promoted it's really hard to go back down and I think

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:55.870
if there were a fair means that didn't involve subjectivity so I feel like

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.150
you're describing my 30 seconds are up I feel like you're describing incentive

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.790
based rules let's look at the sales role where a large part of your salary

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.710
is dependent on performance and actual measurements yep I think that it

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:15.070
can just as easily even more easily drive the wrong behavior you can steal

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:21.350
subtly steal accounts away from your colleagues you can do stuff to game the

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.430
system let's let's try this all the way back so let's say my salary was a base

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:32.110
level of something that I could live on but I had incentives because my job is

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:40.130
intangible because they okay for every let's say our XR budget for dealing with

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:49.630
outages is n dollars some round number ten dollars and through my efforts which

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.750
would be intangible but I could tie it to the might I have a bonus tied to I

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.300
get a chunk of that money back if we're under that budget so if we only spend

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.980
two dollars on incidents throughout the year I get eight dollars back in my as

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.580
my as my incentive bonus even that could drive the wrong behavior I could just

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.620
say okay no more deployments because those might cause me to lose my bonus

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.740
which would not be good for the business so I think it's important that

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:21.500
you have values and things you want to accomplish that are outside of any sort

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:26.980
of incentive so I guess in short I'm pushing back on a said doesn't exist I

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.140
feel like an incentive based whether you call it that or not an incentive based

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.140
reward system or promotion system would create more problems than it solves it

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:44.180
might it might unfortunately every in every incentive base promote every

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.100
promotion system is incentive based okay let's talk about we have a just a little

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.780
bit of time left let's talk about ladder levels yeah I want to talk about

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.060
you talk started but I want to steer this before we finish to a more we've

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.660
talked about everything where they can go badly I want to talk about how they

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.900
can be used effectively as well so but go ahead and start with your stuff and

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.900
I'll try and steer it so I'm gonna I'm gonna share with everyone the most

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.480
common speech I give mentees when they come I

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.920
Brent why can't I get promoted yeah it's it's usually some variant of that

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:30.460
people come and start talking the opposite will be hey manager says I suck

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:39.950
but but but but but you know slurry of excuses and and when I get that one I

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:47.770
go look I'll convert it to a promotion discussion then I said look you're

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:54.310
being defensive what one thing I call Jensen's law of politics is he who is

00:36:54.310 --> 00:37:00.990
defensive loses always you cannot win any battle taking the defense position

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:07.040
only so I said what you're gonna do is you're gonna start having a conversation

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:14.600
with your manager and you're gonna say yes I understand that that you have this

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.500
feeling what I want to have a discussion around is what is the things

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:27.240
that need to be done to go after a promotion because if you try to avoid

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.710
getting fired if that becomes your mission there are so many directions you

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:37.100
can go and some of them in fact are worse what you want to do is set a

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.500
positive direction that you head towards and if you only get 70% there

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:48.780
strong chance you did manage to avoid getting fired okay so it's a common

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:57.500
conversation now at Microsoft we have several bands and I'll to generalize it

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:06.260
I'll call it we have the beginner band we have intermediate let's call it that

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:13.160
beginner intermediate senior principal partner is the ones I'll go with right

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:20.930
now and the way I tell people the purpose of these bands talk about key

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:26.970
expectations that we need people to learn okay every band has an entrance

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:34.180
and an exit that you have to show consistent capability so let me let me

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.100
talk about it the the beginner band the beginner band to get into that you just

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.050
have to pass the interview right and that different teams will have different

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:50.890
skill sets but you just have to pass the interview to get out of that band

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:59.460
there's two key things that you have to do number one you have to show that you

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:05.830
have mastered independently learning what you need to learn so know how do

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:13.150
you stack overflow whatever but you in other words the people who I see that

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:21.420
don't get out of that band are the ones that constantly talk to their managers or

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.860
others around well how do I do this how do I do that how do I do this how do I

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:32.260
do that okay now things that are hard right we've talked about this before

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:38.320
knowledge work is hard and it needs to be reduced but you have to show

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:45.030
capability that you can learn on your own to go that's to leave the current

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:50.930
band you still have to be able to go into the next band and that is you have

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:58.390
to show the capability to go into the next band of getting stuff done okay

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:05.430
that intermediate band when you look at for example Microsoft stats that's where

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.510
most people are yep and that's where the most of the work gets done and

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:15.640
that's in it is and the expectation there is if we're gonna move you into

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.880
the band you've shown capability that you're gonna be able to independently

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.920
get work done and and and those are generally your hot and to be clear my

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.570
previous statement those are typically the highest output folks right and then

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.730
I also want to interrupt and say like the bands of Microsoft are not unique

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:40.440
every company has basically the same band that's my experience as well and

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.000
you can go to levels dot FYI a website it you can compare level systems of

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.620
50 different companies and they're all kind of the same yeah and and I think

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:57.820
it's because there's only four or five key criteria right the first one I said

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.940
you have to show mastery of being able to independently learning but capability

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:08.580
to independently get stuff done okay all right now to get out of that

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.660
intermediate band you have to show mastery of independently getting stuff

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:21.290
done but capability of leadership okay and that's leadership not at leadership

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.930
influence technical leadership getting working through others not necessarily

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:34.400
management to be clear leadership in my criteria is in order to be a leader you

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.160
had to have followers and that means people in leadership can be people

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:47.260
leadership or technical leadership but there has to be an indication that

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:54.270
people are following you or the capability of leadership all right and

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.710
then move it along so they're in that they're in this band then they get into

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:04.140
this band where they go to get out of senior the the senior band is you have

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:11.120
to show mastery of leadership but the capability of what I call investing in

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:18.300
the business so you don't fully own the business but you are a key decision

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.940
maker for that business and now that's actually super critical and the why

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:31.040
leadership comes before that because if you get into once you go into that

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.400
role you have to show that you can make the right trade-offs and the key

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.280
part of leadership is being able to get others to follow that new direction

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.960
even though it may be tough yes absolutely if you are not a leader and

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.160
you move into that and you go oh well what we need to do is this this and

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.720
this I say so many people fail at that they just don't get it like they yeah

00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.240
yeah there is and I'm gonna refer to Maxwell's five levels of leadership not

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.440
gonna go through them all but the first level of leadership is you're put

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.960
in a position of leadership not a silly management but you're maybe you're in the

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.320
senior position then you don't get out of that you don't get to the second

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.440
level until people give you their permission to lead them in other words

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.920
they become followers like yeah I will listen to you because I believe what you

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.400
have to say and you've established some credibility with me a lot of people

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.560
never get out of that they put they're put in that position but they don't

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.240
know how to get to that second position they don't figure out there's

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:37.520
things they need to do to get to that second level yeah so the biggest issue I

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:44.160
see with people when they move into management is that never learn the

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:50.840
difference between management and leadership sure and then finally lastly

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:57.770
partner you're a business owner right if you don't have experience around

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:03.490
understanding how we should invest certain things it's gonna be really hard

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:09.130
for you to take to take the ultimate head or the the top of the pyramid

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:14.810
position and be really accountable and move that business as a whole forward

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:19.730
there's a lot of things you have to pay attention to mm-hmm uh-huh so I want

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:25.620
to talk about we have a couple minutes left but one thing to build on what

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.140
you just talked about is that as a company as a person who is trying to

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:36.780
help people grow through these levels under it is key critical absolutely

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.020
necessary you understand what the transition is like between these levels

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:46.980
because that helps you understand what people need to do in order to grow from

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.860
one level to the other and again I want to rephrase that because the goal

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:56.140
isn't to grow a person from one level to the other the goal is to help someone

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:02.780
grow their abilities to accomplish things and as a side effect of that they

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.300
end up getting promoted because they're able to take on more and more

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.460
capabilities at a much wider scope or level of leadership I worry that again

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:17.720
going back it's really easy for the individual to focus on okay I have these

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.360
levels now I treat them as a checklist here's what I can do to get promoted your

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:28.600
guide as a manager or as a mentor to these folks is to help them understand

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:34.840
that their goal is to provide more value to the business and these are ways in

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.000
which you do it which will also end up getting you promoted because we're gonna

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.680
have a business need for someone to be in this wider scope role and help and

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:52.920
help get things done I think it's again I think the abuse of ladders or maps or

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:58.790
guides whatever you want to call them is a management problem or a leadership

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:04.230
problem sure it is not the fault when I had employees who were every single one

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.190
on one or maybe every other one on one what do I need to do to get promoted to

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:15.980
the next level what do I need to do that is that is easy no that but show show

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.740
consistency that you're operating at the next level done when they would ask that

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:26.970
that is I recognize that and I would lead off of that that is my fault as a

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:34.650
manager it's my fault if you have to ask that it's my fault not entirely if

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:40.500
they're at a lower level it's right you can turn okay fine I could turn around and

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:46.480
ask what do you think you need to do there should be but that discussion like

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.900
I've I talk a lot with employees about career growth like making sure that ACB

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.420
framework where you have stuff that stretches you you want to have a good

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.700
chunk of that stuff it's hard new for you a bunch of stuff you're good at and

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:06.340
minimize the stuff that's sort of below your your wheelhouse talk a lot

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.500
about that making sure people have the appropriate level of stretch work because

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.380
that those are the things that's my job as a manager to make sure those are

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:17.620
things that are guiding you towards a more value to the company and at the

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:23.180
same time a higher level let me let me try something out okay okay mmm this is

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:29.460
not a big stretch for me because this is actually how I do that okay right if

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.420
you remember as I was going through these bands I kept on using the word

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:39.570
independently a lot great first bam you need to show mastery of independently

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:44.690
learning next one independently doing what do you think the next one is

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:50.590
independently leading correct what about the next one this one's harder

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:58.750
independently deciding or make independently making decisions including all

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:05.310
of the follow-through including I didn't know I could have multiple clauses in

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:09.950
my answer no I just want it to be following through on your decisions

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:18.290
right I have several employees who aren't yet ready to go to that principal band

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:24.120
but they're at the top of the senior as an example I've come up with a strategy

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:30.030
that seems to resonate and work because sometimes that independently

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.070
deciding things it's vague oh I decide things all the time independently I'm

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:40.600
gonna check this in I'm gonna make a hack here right it is so the way I frame

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:52.080
it is all right let's look at the KPIs that our executives are targeting which

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:58.320
one of these do you want to take ownership of and they're like what which

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:04.140
one of these do you want to take ownership of what and what that's

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:10.520
going to mean is I'm going to carve off some scope right because obviously you're

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:16.750
one person you can't do this for all of Microsoft but if you can that's super but

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.590
we're gonna carve off the correct scope and what you're going to do is

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:27.200
you're gonna move that KPI you're gonna make all the decisions you'll be

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.000
responsible for talking to all of the people that need to be talked to

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.680
getting the correct assets put in place in a timely fashion etc etc etc the goal

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:48.950
move that KPI be the decision maker for a key portion of the business and when I

00:49:48.950 --> 00:50:01.340
frame it that way they get it they're like oh that's hard I'm like oh yes now

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:06.640
you're beginning to get it now you're beginning to get it all right we could

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:14.160
go on and so let's do this we're out of time so let's close there and then if

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:19.660
there are questions you can ask them either in a comment to this episode you

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:25.060
can join our slack channel you can go to modern testing org to get an invite an

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:30.260
invitation or you can email me Alan and anger weasel calm and go a little

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.940
deeper otherwise we'll move on to the other topics we didn't get to next time

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.780
sound good to you yeah so thank you for going through a little bit of a I think

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:46.090
this is what I mentioned improving the business is the goal I didn't that wasn't

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:50.130
just so I could make the sound modern testinish I think that's my new word I

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:58.570
I really do believe that you need to tie your growth to principles and values

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:04.190
in this case it's going to be both the business that you work for in your

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:08.070
business the business of Allen for example yeah the business of Allen is

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:13.340
doing okay anyway lots more to talk about we will get into it today but
