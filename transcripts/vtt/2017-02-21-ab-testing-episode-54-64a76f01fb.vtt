WEBVTT

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.310
Hey everybody! Howdy! I'm Brent and we're here for episode 54.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.750
Just like I say every time.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.990
This is the first 54 though.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.190
Yeah, you haven't said 54 previously.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.860
I never would have thought when we first started this thing that I'd be saying 54.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.860
54.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.300
Alright, this is my first episode as a non-Microsoft employee.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.900
And the post-Microsoft world for Alan.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.760
It's... I have no regrets.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.920
Oh, you're still in the honeymoon phase, of course.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.280
But tell us more about that.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.300
Well, they shower gifts on me every day before the masseuse comes to my desk.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.780
It's fun. It's refreshing. It's small.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.700
Like the internal tools.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.460
Like the travel site is a pain in the butt.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.420
The expense reporting site, more of a pain in the butt.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.220
I can't submit one of my expense reports

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.820
because for the last day or two, I can't find my boss.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.670
But it can find you.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.350
It can find us. It's hilarious.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.150
So I have several friends that have gone the route you have.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.980
I mean, and one of the common things that they say is...

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.990
First thing they notice is in comparison to Microsoft,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.870
some of these sort of common processes,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.260
just the severe lack of automation on them.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.780
That...

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.140
Yeah, these typical things that you're used to,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.540
that Microsoft has greased the engine on.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.860
Yeah, you realize pretty quickly that it's not as automated as you're used to.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.460
Eh, it's fine.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.940
Yeah, and they say the same thing.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.860
And the other thing is, if for some reason you have the interest,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.820
right, you know what to do.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.540
You've already seen a lot of these processes function in a way

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.100
where people just move on and live with it and don't complain.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.860
So let me give you some examples.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.900
I have so many examples, not sure where to start.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.460
When people ask me about it,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.500
the adjective that comes to mind most often is just refreshing.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.660
It's refreshing.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.340
There's a complete lack of bureaucracy.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.940
Just do what you need to do and don't piss people off.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.780
Don't even piss people off. Don't be a dick.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.370
So what I'm hearing is you have not yet encountered

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.480
any sort of critical version of,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.810
sorry, Alan, that's not how we do things here.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.650
No, no.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.170
If I were to come in and instigate a,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.370
institute a huge amount of process and overhead and regime,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.300
then I would probably hear that.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.140
But that's not my style anyway.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.740
So what I'm finding is, is sure, honeymoon phase,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.780
but my style, my philosophies fit very well.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.900
For example.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.260
So you're not going to go anytime soon and say,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.420
what this business needs is more command and control.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.860
So, but let's talk about that specifically.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.200
My philosophy, which I've had for a while,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.480
but I've now, I read a book by Steve Denning called

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.920
The Leader's Guide to Radical Management.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.680
Steve Denning writes for Forbes a lot.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.480
He's a straight business guy who sort of found Agile

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.480
and says, well, Agile is, this is the way the work is done,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.600
regardless of whether it's software or anything else.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000
But one of his principles is,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.840
give people a framework they can work in

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.760
and then get out of their way.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.440
Which is sort of the opposite of command and control

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.000
in a very sort of Agile way of doing things.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.320
But tell me how you would implement

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.800
a command and control structure,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520
or at least from a micromanagement,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.280
when, let me give you the context of my team.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.280
My team is just shy of 30 people in seven countries.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.150
I have direct reports in Seattle, Austin, Texas,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.010
Copenhagen, Helsinki, Montreal.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.010
How am I going to micromanage that team?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.770
How am I gonna command and control that team?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.370
Brent's making a funny little constipated face.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.970
So first and foremost, I've seen how you operate.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.890
If you wanted to command and control that team,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.210
you would find a way.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.370
I would never ever want to.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.810
No, I mean, just by general,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.920
like even if you were,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.940
even if all of that team was here locally,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.920
you wouldn't want to do that.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.120
We're wired that way.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.000
No, you lay down principles,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.280
you make it very clear how they're gonna be measured.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.280
And then, I mean, this is too hand-wavy.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.640
Then you say, okay, now tell me how I can help.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640
What resources do you need from me?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.000
Right, and I totally forgot San Francisco as well.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.400
Yeah, I wasn't counting.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.880
I do think it was, you said,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.880
Seattle, now San Francisco, Texas, Copenhagen, and.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.640
Finland, Helsinki.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.210
Finland, that's five.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.230
And you said seven countries.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.070
Well, is there somebody?

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.550
San Francisco is not yet a new country.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.470
Those were, well, maybe it's also.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.150
I might've been exaggerating a little bit there,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.910
but I do have skipped levels.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.750
And so I have, I like the combination.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.310
I have three leads reporting to me,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.030
as well as six ICs if I count,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.830
right, one, two, three, four, five, six, yeah.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.290
Okay.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.870
So it's good to get a little hands-on,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.510
get a little, and it's basically all of Unity services.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.510
Everything from ads and analytics, big services,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.790
down to like crash reporting and multiplayer

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.610
and the launcher, just technically a service,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.450
has a back end.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.290
So you're in it.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.170
Anything that has a back end, basically.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.090
Your Unity engineering services is what you're saying.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.100
Sure.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.940
Cool.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.060
It's a ton of fun.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.260
And what I'm finding out is, as I expected going in,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.360
is there's a lot of different ways of doing things.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.920
Different tools used, different approaches.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.480
Some teams are very much,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.520
are more along the agile spectrum

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.560
and they don't, they track bugs

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.480
just like they're just pure work items.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.400
There's no real tracking a bug database

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400
or backlog they're found and they're fixed.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.600
As I was saying. I like those teams.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.440
Yeah.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.320
Yeah.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.560
So as you can imagine,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.520
my job is at first is to assess

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.120
and kind of get a story, assess the current state.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.440
You don't have a going forward battle plan

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.240
that you want to announce for the first time today

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.200
on the podcast?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.040
No, I'm still assessing the current state.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.720
Getting to know people.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.680
I've now had one-on-ones with almost all

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.320
of my direct reports, at least one.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.200
So slowly getting to know people.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.400
I did spend two days in San Francisco

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.640
getting to know the team down there.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.080
Both on the test side, the QA side

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.120
and the engineering side.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.400
I've met with recruiting quite a bit

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.280
because I have open headcount in San Francisco a lot

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.920
and then in Montreal, I have a open headcount there too.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.960
So two different recruiters working with them.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.080
So slowly working my way around the company.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.920
Huge Slack usage, which is awesome.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.080
One thing, and again, no regrets, no digs on Microsoft

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.160
but my last team, Microsoft Teams, a Slack competitor,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.160
I think is a great solution for Office 365 organizations

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.000
who have never used Slack before.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.040
But having used Slack for the last three weeks,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.360
I don't think they're ever gonna get a Slack user

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.640
away from Microsoft.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.480
I'm sorry, a Slack user to go to Teams.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.240
It's just too much farther along.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.680
It's so much faster, so much easier to use.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.960
But anyway, we have basically all conversations from Slack.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.960
It seems like their strategy is to go after the enterprise

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.840
which is a common strategy here.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.040
And to be clear, I think that's a good strategy.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.280
When you have a new product, you can go right after

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.480
the competitor and try and steal their customers,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.160
very difficult, or go after the market

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.990
that hasn't been claimed yet.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.750
And I think it's still a smart plan

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.750
but I'm loving using Slack.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.590
I get...

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.510
I would say in general, Microsoft's gonna default

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.550
for the enterprise, because for a lot of cases,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.030
most of our markets, we own the enterprise.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.550
Yeah, and that's Microsoft's customer.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.870
We're software developers for the enterprise

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.510
with a few exceptions.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.990
So I get...

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.110
This is including anything from systems

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.510
like to approve an expense report or to approve leave

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.150
or including all those sorts of mails.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.510
Maybe on a crazy, crazy day,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.230
I may get five or six emails.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.590
I think I just killed Brent.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.650
Everything else is inside.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.970
I think the last time I had a day like that

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.570
was when I was an intern at Microsoft and...

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.570
I hadn't been hooked up to the DLs yet.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.890
Yeah, I get more than...

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.910
At Microsoft, I would get 50 mails on Christmas.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.750
Yeah.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.320
It's fun.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.360
I mentioned I went to San Francisco.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.160
There was a hack week for services in San Diego

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
where there were about 125 or so Unity developers

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.120
and testers there.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.440
I went down there, not the hack,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.510
but for two days just to meet some people,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.910
accelerate some ramp up there,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.740
and so that was cool.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.620
So actually, I do have a question for you.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:31.480
Do you have a sense yet of what your job

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.080
is going to be to add value to the business?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.000
Yeah.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840
You do?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.520
Because what I've heard so far

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.550
is the way you're thinking of driving your team,

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.630
and it's so fuzzy.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.070
Battle plans haven't been laid out,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.990
but you're gonna be very principle driven.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.670
I think the mission is clear.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.270
It's the implementation that's not,

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.590
or the execution and tactics.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.830
Okay, what's your mission?

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.790
The mission is to...

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.290
I haven't put it into words yet.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.370
It's a bit in my head, but it's to...

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.890
Do awesome shit.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.090
No, no, no, it's about, and let me talk about it.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.650
We can figure out what the name is later.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.970
But the mission is definitely build Unity service

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.930
testing culture or establish...

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.090
Let me talk about it backwards.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.890
Something quality culture?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.730
No, no, no.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.290
What we have in the services at Unity

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.450
is a bunch of different disparate approaches

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.810
to service testing.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.610
Different tools, different approaches,

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.170
and they're different services, so it's okay.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.770
Also what's happened is because they've never,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.090
they've been under two or three different directors before.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.850
This is the first time with me coming in,

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.370
they've actually combined all services QA

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.850
and under one manager.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.690
Okay.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.530
So by...

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.290
Ooh, functional organization.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.410
No, just put a cork in it.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.930
Oops.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.930
Be quiet, Brent.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.390
Gee whiz, Brent.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.830
You're interrupting my flow.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.870
What I'm doing in establishing the current state

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.630
of learning what everybody's doing,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.270
learning how each of the services is tested

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.910
is from that I'll be able to build a plan on

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.270
what are the areas where it makes sense to consolidate,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.830
what are the areas where I think it's fine

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.830
and I need to defend.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.430
For example, if someone's,

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.410
there may be an old school,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.250
someone old school says,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.250
you have to have a bug database and track these things.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.770
I say, well actually,

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.410
I can point out how it's actually okay to not have it

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.530
if you're fixing all the bugs as you find them.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.490
So choosing where to defend,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.810
where to consolidate

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.010
and kind of establishing that shared vision for that team

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.850
does two things.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.810
One, it gets some consistency and efficiency

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.050
and how Unity tests services,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.130
which is great.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.890
That's sort of the tactical goal,

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.170
but it helps build the services QA team,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.490
which they haven't felt like it

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.140
and they felt like there's no camaraderie team

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.500
and again, they're spread across seven different locations,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.300
but at the same time, I'm building that team.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.740
Sort of the culture of Allen,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.580
the culture of not-

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.060
You're trying to build a team culture.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.900
You have a bunch of people organized underneath you,

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.340
but that's far different from a team.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.900
And because I believe that one thing that isn't happening,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.460
I'm huge on talking about ideas and learning

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.060
and great ideas come from other ideas merging together.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.900
They don't have that sharing culture on like,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.940
oh, here, I found like there's,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.860
for example, three different products.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.180
You have seven teams and there's 18 test harnesses.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.300
No, it's not test harnesses as much as,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.740
oh, we use this because this

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.940
and we use this because this

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.820
and they're not really like,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.860
oh, how about if we mix that chocolate

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.700
and that peanut butter

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.900
and make a damn good little Reese's Peanut Butter Cup

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.620
over here, I think because they're not connected

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.180
and talking with each other, that sharing isn't happening.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.700
They're focused a lot on need to solve the problem

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.980
for my team.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.740
So the world that you're talking about

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.660
sounds like a bunch of very silo specific,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.820
probably organically built tooling that has proven itself.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.180
And no, because they're a modern company

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.700
who's aren't so stupid, they build all their own tools.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.940
They use, everything is,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.820
they use open source tools, common tools,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.700
but they don't know that each other,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.540
oh, hey, you're using that?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.360
I'm using that too.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.820
I had no idea.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.620
I'm making those connections.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.540
It isn't like Microsoft 10 years ago

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.830
when everyone's building a test harness

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.190
or it isn't like Microsoft today

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.910
when everyone's building a data pipeline.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.750
No, it's a knowledge management problem is what you're-

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.070
It is, absolutely.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.650
So I'll figure out how to phrase that,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.370
but that's the initial mission.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.930
Sharing is caring.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:14:59.770
Shut up.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.370
And one thing that's,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.650
I wanna tie that into one other thing

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.190
is that's a Unity review process.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.230
Interesting.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.270
Is, we may be talking about it more later

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.870
when I've been there longer,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.750
but it's three questions, three times a year.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.590
And the first question,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.130
I'll get into the other ones in another podcast,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.490
but it's just, what is your mission at Unity?

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.850
So it's having that in my head

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.530
as I sort of figure things out,

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.050
it's like, oh, it's becoming more and more clear to me

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.010
what my mission is.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.010
At least that will change over time.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.570
That's why you do it three times a year.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.790
But here's the great thing.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.190
Now compare this to your history at Microsoft.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.850
I know Microsoft is a lot lighter weight.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.370
But the three questions, three times a year-

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.730
Microsoft is lighter weight?

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.690
Has gotten lighter weight

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.370
since we used to have to write these books once a year.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.170
The review process is literally

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.690
managers, three questions, three times a year,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.090
you have a conversation about those things.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.570
I think we have six.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.540
Backup, there isn't HR doesn't require a check

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.480
to make sure you've done it.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.080
It's you're asked to do it and you're expected to do it,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.040
but nobody's following up and making sure.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.800
There's nothing written down.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.760
Okay.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.720
This is just a conversation you have to have.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.120
It's great.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.600
The companies at the stage where,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.840
and I think most small companies go through this,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.260
I hope they can stay there as long as they can

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.500
where they want to avoid doing anything

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.510
that makes them feel like a big company.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.280
So it's kind of fun.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.120
See, you have your Microsoft goggles on.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.260
No, no, no, that's great.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.060
But I've also done some lightweight research here

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.700
and that's, so that's how a lot of small companies start up.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.860
It does limit growth

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.840
because at some point in time you can't really scale.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.600
And so they go, okay, they had to make a decision.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.920
Are we happy with the growth level that we're at right now

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.900
or do we want to take some of these pains?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.420
Unity's not public, right?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.260
No.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.580
Okay, yeah.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.140
So that probably won't shift over until it's become public.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.340
At some point it may shift,

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.060
but one thing I've learned talking to my team

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.980
is everybody just loves working there

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.900
and loves what they're doing.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.340
Again, we'll go back to my word from five minutes ago.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.900
Refreshing.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.980
Let's go into the next topic

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.300
and we can talk about my team there a little bit as well.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.020
I think actually it's quite relevant.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.420
Perhaps.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:42.800
So it's actually been a while since we released 53,

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.820
I think it was about a month ago.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.660
What's the date today?

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.760
Three weeks ago?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.400
Maybe, actually almost a month, yeah.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.840
Yeah, and then during that time

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.640
there was a lot of activity on the slide channel

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.820
where what was being discussed

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.020
is a problem that was quite common back in the day for me.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.500
I'm pretty, I don't know how.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.640
Maybe it's super relevant to you now.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.180
But the question is,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.800
if you are a leader of a pure QA team,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.870
what are the goals of your team?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.070
And there were several things talked about.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.780
A lot of the discussion was,

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.620
I mean, this was common back in the day for me

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.580
where people would propose KPI and testers.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.980
One of the things that testers are really good at

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.580
is knocking holes in everything.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.380
So that's one of the things I observed

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.340
on the Slack channel was essentially,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.460
hey, code coverage, that's a goal, right?

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.180
No, it's not a goal.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.800
Code coverage is a wonderful tool and a horrible metric.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.640
Yeah.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.100
That's my standard line there.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.980
Great for finding where you may have missed testing,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.180
but shooting for a target

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.160
will always generate the wrong behavior.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.200
Hindsight 2020 for me,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.400
so before I sort of start monologuing on my opinion on here,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.680
like what do you think of this topic

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.560
as it perhaps relates to you?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.520
You've spoken about it very abstractly.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.360
Yeah.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.520
So the question is, what's the role of QA?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.210
What are the goals of a QA team?

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.520
And to make it tighter.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.160
So assume that it's a pure QA team

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.440
that's perhaps partnering with a dev team.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.540
What are the goals of that QA team

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.200
that might be independent from the goals of the dev team?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.020
Well, I am not a,

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.180
and listen before you jump in here.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.180
I am still remain not a fan of a dedicated QA team.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.430
So one thing I didn't mention about Unity,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.370
I think it's a very, very common industry.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.870
So Microsoft has done their, Microsoft has not.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.430
Microsoft has another combined engineering thing where.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.510
Unified.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.750
Unified engineering thing.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.590
I call it, yeah,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.110
because there's, you and I call it unified,

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.390
they call it combined.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.230
But,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.750
But if we do it last enough,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.950
we can fix this.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.830
Get rid of the testers and the developer.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.390
We've talked about it a bunch of times.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.870
I'll slam some tequila later in honor of this.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.230
We talked, I also talked a lot about my role

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.270
on the teams team.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.350
My last team at Microsoft,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.930
where I was the quality guy to kind of

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.350
make sure that developers were doing

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.270
what they were supposed to be doing.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.190
And that included making sure the tools were in place,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.190
coaching, whatever was needed to make sure they were,

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.070
we were getting enough testing activity to happen.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.990
Plus some vendors doing some manual testing.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.910
The idea of the dedicated QA team,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.650
that I'm thinking of the team that gets software

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.950
at the end like we used to,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.830
or even we were on the team from the beginning,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.550
but we got something here, test this before,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.070
way too late.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.950
Even if it was one month into the product cycle,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.470
the thing we got was way too late.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.990
We should have been involved earlier.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.230
So that sort of.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.540
And I spent, you did as well,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.570
but spent almost half of my,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.570
maybe longer of my QA career fighting that.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.610
Yeah.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.690
So because it's a constant fight getting those,

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.410
getting those dev or getting those PM to involve QA

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.730
at the beginning.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:53.160
So that model sort of worked and it worked.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.200
And remember I had some of my vendors

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.000
working involved in stand up

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.200
with some of the key feature areas

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.960
to make sure they were involved early.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.380
The way Unity are structured,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.380
which is very similar to how many organizations

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.600
doing agile software development function

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.720
is every one of my,

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.560
across to a person,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.440
across my 28, 29 person org

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.560
is embedded in a development team.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.440
So they work for me and I get that consolidation.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.080
But as far as the day to day work,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.240
and they maybe have a lead that works for me

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.360
who kind of make sure that they're coordinated,

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.000
but their day to day work,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
they're embedded in as the test expert in a feature team.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.320
The test expert or the test bitch?

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.400
Expert.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.040
Okay, that's fantastic.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.400
I have great conversations with product owners already,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.880
our POs about,

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.720
like I had one,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.280
this guy Andy came to me this week and said,

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.520
so you're not Monday.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.160
Oh, you're not supposed to mention names.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.000
It's fine.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720
I'm not throwing them under the bus.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.080
I can talk about them when they're awesome.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:22:59.920
All right, fair enough.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.360
If I don't mention a name,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.160
doesn't mean you're not awesome.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.000
But anyway, he said,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.800
so how do I work with you?

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.640
And I said,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.330
and he said,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.810
so what do I do about,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.090
should I come to you when I have work,

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.210
I think that those,

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.450
your guys need to do?

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.970
I said, well, that seems stupid, doesn't it?

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.770
My job is to offer,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.250
is to look for consolidation,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.330
everything in my mission we talked about.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.570
I'm looking for how to consolidate testing.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.610
I'm gonna coach them on how,

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.850
maybe how to get things done

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.090
and what tools to use and learn from them.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.170
But as far as prioritizing their work,

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.850
that's not my job.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.210
You know, the PO could take care of that.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.970
They know what testing or what quality work needs

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.010
to get done.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.610
And they're empowered to do that.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.210
Unity is huge on empowerment.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.130
And you do what needs to get done.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.170
So these guys are definitely not the test bitches

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.170
or the test experts.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.010
I like the idea from-

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.650
But they're not the ones doing all of the testing.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.210
Absolutely not.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.650
They're the ones looking for,

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.370
they're the ones testing the things that,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.570
testing for the things

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.730
that probably no one else could find.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.900
I have both people,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.140
everybody's air quote technical,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.980
but they do have the concept of the SDET and the STE,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.140
the test developer and the tester.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.820
I have some of both across my organization,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.140
which is fine.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.220
But they, everybody does kind of everything.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.540
It's a, they're bought,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.060
whether they use it by name or not,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.900
they're bought into the specialized in general

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.340
and by the time I get through with my little,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.180
part a little bit of Allen culture across my org,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.620
everyone will know what a specialized in generalist is.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.460
I've already talked to them about

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.580
the five orders of ignorance.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.820
So there's some bits of my tool bag

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.460
that came out naturally.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.860
So anyway, they're embedded in these teams across the org.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.100
That by the way is one of my favorite parts

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.540
of joining the new team.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.460
It's starting all over on your series of,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.420
these are the speeches I use every time.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.780
So anyway, I mentioned embedded in the teams.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.180
I like the idea from Google of experts,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.420
not just in testing,

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.500
but in improving developer productivity.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.660
So I kind of expect them,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.420
again, everyone's different getting used to the team,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.780
but for the most part,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.780
they sort of get the necessity for efficiency.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.900
Are there better ways to do this?

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.260
So when I poke and think,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.140
oh, here's something you could do,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.030
in most cases they've already done it.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.300
So there's a backend service for CodBuild.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.260
Can you build the Unity app?

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.420
Oh, by the way, and I've built the Unity,

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.260
I'm working on a game.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.540
I have a little shooter I'm building in Unity.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.300
It's interesting writing a game.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.900
I don't know if you've ever written a game before, but-

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.140
Long time ago.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.860
I spend more time in the editor working with physics

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.540
and lighting than I do actually writing the code,

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.780
just to try and make it look right.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.900
So it's an interesting little shift for me

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.260
in my software development.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.780
What kind of shooter are you building?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.860
Is this like a FPS?

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.900
No, like a Galaga type game.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.460
It's based on one of the demos.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.300
Oh, good.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.620
But anyway, but I'm using all of the services I can

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.820
with this thing to get used to how they integrate.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.880
So each of these services has a entry point in the editor.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.040
I was going somewhere with this.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.600
Oh, and then there's this cloud build thing.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.600
So I can choose to build my project in the cloud,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.620
which is pretty cool.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.620
And I can target any one of Unity's zillion 30-ish targets.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.860
I can't build for Xbox or for Samsung TV or for Windows

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.860
or for Android or whatever.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.660
And then there's all these different versions of Unity's

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.580
and things that I thought,

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.220
well, how do you handle the combination exploration of this?

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.020
And they already, they know about combinatorial testing

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.100
and they have some stuff to go directly on the back end,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.420
beat out, make sure all these things

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.660
continue to work all the time.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.260
So it's, and sure enough, the builds have,

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.900
again, my project's pretty simple now,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.910
but they've worked out great.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.990
Little bit of a tangent there.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.990
Let's reel it back in.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.750
Neat story, Alan.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.910
Hey, what are the goals of a QA team?

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:20.790
I think they're buried in that story.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.950
I think the goals are to,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.270
and I don't want to fall back on Jim Morris, the remainder,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.590
but it's not entirely it.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.790
It's not being the test pitch.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.630
It's finding-

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.870
I will kick you in the shins on the podcast.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.710
And you'll miss my-

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.550
I hear that.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.350
And you'll miss my shin and hit something more important.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.350
Goals of the QA team are to increase developer productivity,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.680
identify risk.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.120
Let me just stop there.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.680
I like the idea of the chicken little,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.470
part chicken little, part Eeyore.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.310
Okay.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.230
It'll never work.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.070
This guy is tall.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.980
I'm just, I like-

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.510
I don't, I don't.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.480
I do like the thinking behind the people with that,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.080
but I find it's great to think that way.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.340
Don't communicate that way.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.500
Oh, I agree.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.260
So it's one of the things that I heard

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.140
based on what you're discussing.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:26.010
Like, so right now, I absolutely adore your model.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.930
The-

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:27.930
Aww.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.290
But the one thing I think that is an opportunity here

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.210
is for you to also put in

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.420
some form of sticky obligation

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.180
for your guys to proactively communicate

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.040
and share.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.130
Because I think the, you do run the,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.180
so empowered local teams is fantastic.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.700
But if without any sort of thing to balance it, right,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.900
they're going to become siloed

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.900
and this knowledge management problem

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.900
that you're going to have is just continue or get worse.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.560
One of the things I think you should consider is,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.060
and it's fuzzy in my head,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.580
so I don't have something concrete for you,

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.920
but what are actually the useful things

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.870
that aren't going to start a bureaucracy engine

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.110
that you could tell these guys,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:35.910
hey, useful solutions that can be shared across,

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.300
I want you to feel morally obligated

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.690
to think about those generalized patterns

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.010
and contributing to a solution.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.130
Because I think one of the things,

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.570
as every team is focused on that,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.530
you're going to be the guy that goes,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.130
oh, you have that problem?

00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:00.130
Hey, my team that's 1200 miles away from you

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.320
will actually just solve that.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.850
So, again-

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.330
So then you become a knowledge command and control bottleneck.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.890
I think we've talked, just a minute ago,

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.090
talked about learning from each other as part of that,

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.250
but let me take a moment back and talk about,

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.010
not my mission, but Unity's mission.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.490
Three principles.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.970
Now, let's see if I can remember them.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.270
Democratize development.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.380
Okay.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.280
Solve hard problems.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.120
Okay.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.440
Enable developer success.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.060
Everyone at the company lives those principles.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:35.900
Okay.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.580
It's about sharing and enabling others,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.420
picking, not just solving the hard problems,

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.940
but picking the right hard problems to solve,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.860
which is very much reflective

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.860
of what you were talking about.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.980
It's like, yes, people are expected to identify

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.260
and solve and share the hard problems.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.350
And then I think one that if it's QA more than,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.670
again, I'm getting used to calling it QA,

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.310
they call it QA Unity, but we call it,

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.030
oh, I called the test and there's, I don't care.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.870
I don't either.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:04.710
I don't either.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.550
Okay.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.150
Actually, I do care.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:07.990
We talk about-

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.830
Engineer.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.190
When we talk about enabling developer success,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.630
it's enabling our end users or developers.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.310
We want-

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.150
Oh, okay.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.990
So, you know, from working on Xbox is

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.830
primary customer is not the end user,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.150
it's actually those developer making those games.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.390
The easier we make it for developers

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.950
to make games that make them money,

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.030
money, money, so-

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:32.990
Money and Unity.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:34.630
What do you call money at Unity?

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:35.470
Money.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.950
But the easier you make it for them

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.790
to be successful developing games,

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.080
the more successful we are.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.420
Right.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.260
That the-

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.740
So, anyways, but going rewinding again, backing up.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.260
Yes, absolutely agree with you.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.540
That is definitely a goal.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.080
I want the team to solve hard problems

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.960
that are hard problems that maybe other parts of the team

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.030
haven't recognized yet and be able to benefit from that.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.590
Yeah, it reminds me, there is an Agile model,

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.310
I'm forgetting the name of the company

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.070
that published this.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.590
So, not only do they

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.430
have,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.250
I don't know if you guys are calling them

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.450
Scrum teams or whatever,

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.290
but we'll call them the little Agile teams

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.690
that are working together towards a common goal.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:31.930
But they've also created a secondary series

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.810
of these teams where

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.440
we talk about specializing generalists,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.200
generalizing specialists,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.560
but this is specifically targeted around

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.720
getting specializations in a community on a weekly basis

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.120
and getting them to work towards a common secondary goal.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.880
Whatever they invent, right?

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.520
But I actually thought that was a,

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.880
when I first read it, I'm like,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.880
really, this is gonna be massive overhead.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.200
But I think once that rolls and you make it very clear,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.270
no, you're really on,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.870
and strike the balance of the fact

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.470
that you're telling them to be on two active teams,

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.130
which is generally frowned on.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.230
But one is depth and one is breadth.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.830
And this breadth one is,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.430
if you do it right,

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:39.010
then knowledge correctly and naturally starts bubbling out.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.810
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.530
I forget, I'm even forgetting.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.010
They don't call it squads or just wacky.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.490
No, it doesn't need a name.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.770
And I think that's important also.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.050
This is part of building,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.010
I think we'll have to do things like that

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.450
to build sort of the services team,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.450
even though everyone's embedded elsewhere.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.590
Already, based on a conversation I've had

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:09.050
with one of my leads, they are going to put together,

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.620
they're gonna take their team offline for,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.640
not offline, but take a couple days with them

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.200
and sort of go through a little workshop

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.200
on just among themselves trying to identify

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.420
the current state and where they wanna go,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.680
which is great, helps me out.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.360
And they've sort of taken it on themselves

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.920
to do that, which is great.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.600
I think there's going to be many opportunities

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.720
to do things like that.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.320
It's honeymoon phase, but so far,

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.000
it's just, I haven't met a person that,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.200
like everyone from super,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.360
I don't call them senior,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.940
the organizationally, it feels very flat,

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.780
which is good.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.620
I've-

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.940
And where there's hierarchy,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.140
with what you describe on the,

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.900
how empowerment actually,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.780
that empowerment is an action,

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.180
not a management buzzword.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.500
It's gonna feel even flatter.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.980
Because part of the thing that you're essentially saying,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.300
unlike, let's say, your former company,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.580
where-

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.060
Oh my God, yeah, I have thought about-

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.420
One of the expectations would be,

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.070
so your role here,

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.890
if you were to go into a role like this,

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.810
you're gonna be expected to, every week,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.810
join, I don't know, 567 status meetings,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.790
where you have to represent the progress

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.210
of your whole entire organization.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.240
And I don't get the sense

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.200
that you're gonna have that requirement.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.000
No, no, it's about sharing and learning this.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.560
Yeah, no.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.640
But I think, you know, hierarchy,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.880
I didn't realize it till I left how,

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.160
at Microsoft, how huge it was.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.280
It's like, you,

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.530
sometimes you couldn't even email someone

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.140
based on their title.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.460
Like, oh, I'm too junior to talk,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.380
did you go directly to them?

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.460
Yeah.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.300
That just doesn't exist.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.860
And again, part of a small company too.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.960
If you're a company of 1,400 people,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.520
with 500, 400 engineers.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.600
Yeah, but-

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.080
We both have been in teams that,

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.120
like I've been in teams that are smaller than that.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.280
And so did that, the rule that you're talking about,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.080
persists.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.720
Oh no, don't waste his time.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.920
Yeah, oh, I worked,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.360
and I had someone who worked for me

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.320
who talked to my skip level directly,

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.930
and I got shit for it.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.770
You did?

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.970
Yeah, because my manager came to me and said-

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.610
Why is this guy coming to me?

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.810
Hey, he went and talked to Tom directly.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.950
That, if he has stuff he needs to talk about,

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.350
you or to me,

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.750
you can't go up that many levels of hierarchy directly.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:19.730
You know what?

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:23.580
Yeah, I know you made up the name,

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.620
so maybe I'll talk to you after the podcast.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.140
But stuff like that just ticks me off,

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.140
because that is a dude who is trying to do PR control.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.500
All right.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.220
Did I answer your question eventually?

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.820
We don't have direct yes or no answers here.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.100
Well, no.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.200
So in terms of what are the goals of a QA team?

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.690
My belief, again, is a QA team,

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.490
and I think you described it,

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.210
even in your organization,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.250
you described it differently,

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:11.250
but a QA team's responsibility is to accelerate quality.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.190
Yeah.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.670
But quality from a customer point of view.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.990
I actually remember you had that definition

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.350
for many, many years.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.190
Yes.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:26.830
And you see I successfully didn't use the forbidden words.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.230
I don't think you've talked about it on the podcast.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.750
It's been a long time if we have.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.590
No.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.230
So my view, if you have a dedicated QA team,

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.590
first and foremost,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.590
it's not a goal per se,

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.070
because usually when people ask goals,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.480
they want something that has a KPI in it.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.800
But if you start off with the idea

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.000
that a QA team's role is to accelerate

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.500
the achievement of shippable product quality,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.860
framed very tightly with that,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.860
my definition of quality has the square root

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.020
of nothing to do with bugs.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.500
It has to do with customer satisfaction.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.180
Then you can take the context of your current team

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.620
and break it down.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:31.840
The, it is very context sensitive in my experience.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.370
I do not like goals of, I will automate all things.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.300
The problem with that,

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.140
when you are in a leadership of a QA team,

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.140
the best thing for you to do is number one,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.900
realize that the sort of the definition,

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.260
the vision or whatever you want to call it

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.700
that I just mentioned,

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.180
then take the business KPIs

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.020
that your executives care about.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.460
What are the needles they're trying to move?

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.010
And then convert your goals,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.090
something that leverages the skill set of your team,

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.130
but says, hey, you know what?

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:17.210
I'm gonna take ownership of knocking down 3%

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.430
of whatever this business KPI you're caring about

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.990
by using my team's assets.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.890
Sure, right, in my view, there's three general things.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.700
Business value.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.260
Now, if you're in a QA team,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.980
business value is going to be

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.300
whatever you're doing to measure customer satisfaction

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.540
around your product.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.090
That's QA secret sauce.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.370
We're good at customer satisfaction,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.610
but drive it, not from theory.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.840
Second, calendar time.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.880
Calendar time, once you've lost it,

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.360
you can't get it back.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.420
You can't hire more months in the year to scale up.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.350
Calendar time is a critical resource,

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.510
particularly in this services agile world.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.190
And then probably the easiest one,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.030
but also, well, depending on the organization,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.870
it might not be as valuable as the prior two.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.790
And that's engineering time.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.660
Much like what you're talking about,

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.420
you want to improve developer productivity.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.100
Which is actually quite close to accelerating quality.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.740
Well, actually, I'd take that back.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.900
Because when you were telling the story,

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.340
the word developers overload it.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:40.980
Because the developer is not only your Unity's customer,

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.420
that's the class of people, their game developers.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.700
But they're actually a title within Unity.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.540
So when I first heard,

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.780
when you, you know, half hour ago,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.500
when you were talking about developer productivity,

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.100
I was assuming it was the in-house developer

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.660
is not your customer side.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.660
Maybe I interpreted entirely.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.540
No, actually, when I was talking about developer productivity,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.540
in that case, I was talking about in-house developers.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.380
Right.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.980
To be clear.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.820
Yeah.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.180
So that's sort of the engineering time.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.500
If QA is, can eliminate waste on that front,

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.850
I'm not a big fan of that.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.650
I'm not a big fan of that.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:33.320
I'm not a big fan of targeting efficiency first.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.240
I'd rather target productivity.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.800
But as part of that, if QA can eliminate waste,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.280
and that results in a shorter calendar time,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.520
which results in a happier customer.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.880
Efficiency will result in shorter calendar time.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.180
Efficiency will, productivity will.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.380
Efficiency is about reducing,

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.780
well, generally, my definition of efficiency

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.500
is about reducing time wasted.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.040
Right, time.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.600
But there is another pivot, and I agree,

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.720
there is another pivot on efficiency

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.480
that I find is actually used most often,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.400
and that's the elimination of idle time.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.250
And I don't wanna go into it today.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.630
We don't have enough time, but the studies have shown

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.910
that if you wanna move fast,

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:45.500
you need to make sure that there is actually idle time

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.250
in your people's daily calendars.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.800
A metaphor.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.960
A fully utilized freeway is known as a parking lot.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.550
So if you fully utilize all the resources on your team,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.850
you're gonna go slow.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.130
And if you don't believe me, Alan's looking at me like,

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.450
I don't know if I should make fun of you.

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:19.010
You can look it up in Rene Anderson's book.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.320
If you don't believe me, you'll believe him.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.360
I believe him way more than I believe you.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.480
Fair enough.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.880
That's Flow.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.840
What's that book, Engineering Flow?

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.920
The Flow of Software Development.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.000
I forget the exact title.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.320
Principles of the software development flow

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.920
or maybe just development flow.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.760
Yeah.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.980
Yeah.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.800
All right.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.100
Is there anything else to talk about?

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.370
Are we done?

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.210
I think we're done.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.050
Where we at?

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:50.050
Hey, more stories of unity coming up?

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:51.410
Yep.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.450
But not today.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:53.290
Nope.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.330
All right.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:55.790
I guess we're done.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:56.650
I'm Alan.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.770
I'm Brent.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.610
And we will see you next time for 55.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:01.450
Double naked.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:02.290
It's not.
