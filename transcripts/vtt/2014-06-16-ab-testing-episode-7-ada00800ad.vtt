WEBVTT

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.980
Hey, I'm Alan and I'm Brent and we're here for episode seven seven seven of a B testing Wow seven episodes

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.100
Congratulations, Brent. Whoo-hoo. That's a prime number, right? Seven is prime. You're very good at math. Yes

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.500
I've been re-listening to our last podcast and and rethinking about the NFR discussion and and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.260
Recognize that seven was the the number you felt was the right one for no, I was just making up numbers. All right, burn up

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.210
All right, so we are gonna do something crazy today wacky wacky totally wacky. We're gonna start right off with the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
Nice you're improving on I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.110
You know, I spend most of my drive to work with the windows down just practicing that line

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.990
Yeah, you clear your throat. Me. Me. Me. Well, my daughter gave me a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.630
Microphone

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.590
It's not a it's like her little kids what mostly plays princess songs, but I sing into it in the car

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.670
Yeah, I try not to get laughed at her or pulled over. Do you have the frozen memorized now? No, do you want to build? No

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.570
My we're in a no frozen zone my my son

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.650
Nfz a no frozen zone my son last week

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.770
Drop my wife on the floor because he started doing a lip sync dance to do you want to build a snowman?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.170
But that was funny cuz he did it sarcastically

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.210
Yeah, sure. This is and next week more fun from the Jensen household

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.070
all right, so

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.780
Mailbag item Alan. I actually had a lunch yesterday with with a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.460
Colleague of ours Ben. Oh, yeah, and he had to cancel on Ben this week. I had the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.700
Tangent I got food poisoning over the weekend. So I was wiped out on Monday. We're supposed to have lunch on Monday

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.060
Did you guys go to sushi?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.460
No. Oh, yes, actually we did we got yeah better. I usually go to sushi too. So so Alan is a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.380
Wacky mold of vegetarian. So just curious. How do you get food poisoning from carrots?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.620
well, you go to a certain local establishment, I won't name and you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.940
Get a garden burger at onion rings and take your chances. We okay. Anyway moving on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.580
Um, so he and I had lunch and one of the things he wanted to start with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.300
was

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.140
He said hey, I just want you to know that I am getting comments

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.180
From all over. I don't know what that means. Maybe he hangs out with the same three listeners. We've identified or your kid or my son

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.430
Yes, and he said

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.670
Ever since you and I have started putting on the the podcast

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.740
There's been a great deal of people coming to him influenced

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.230
positively by that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.870
in

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.710
particular leads

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.870
That leads are finding value in what we're doing because it's helping them

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.910
Lead their people through change. Well, we did because we kind of talked a lot about leading through change

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.100
There's there's one thing I wanted to carry on with that further today because we

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.660
Were that topic is not done and as you know

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.190
organizationally corporate wide we are nowhere close to done with this change and and and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.990
There are a lot of people still working through that change management

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.550
Agreed. Yes. All right. Where are you going? Um

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.830
So one of the things I wanted to spend a little bit of time on is

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.830
Is trying to help those leads so so Ben and I chatted and I said what value are they getting exactly from us?

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.090
and that is

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.090
what they're getting is

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.540
the message to to their people that helps them to

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.180
Move forward

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.400
Right right now one of the things that are happening is a lot of this data isn't being pushed down to the leads

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.900
That data are I think data datum

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.700
So I wanted to start off with a

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.240
quote

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.280
I'm knocking the microphone. Sorry for that. I want to start off with a quote that I that I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.200
Recently encountered. Okay, it's a little bit longish, but I'd love to see what your thoughts are for score and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.640
I'm not different different quote. All right, go ahead 12 day

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.820
in

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.220
practice all

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.220
Systems do insist on exercising their own creativity

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.900
They never accept imposed solutions

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.540
Predetermined designs or well articulated plans that have been generated somewhere else

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.360
too often

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.980
we interpret their refusal to change as

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.300
Resistance we say that people innately resist change

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.270
But the resistance we experience from others is not to change itself

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.390
It is to the particular process of change that believes in imposition

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:49.710
Rather than creation it is the resistance of a living system to be treated as a non-living thing

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.130
It is an an assertion of the system's right to create

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.900
It is life insisting on its primary responsibility

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.510
to create itself

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.230
That's that's the quote what that essentially means and where is that from it is from a book called a simpler way

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.380
What's your thoughts?

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.990
My thoughts I was gonna ask you to put it a simpler way, but it makes it makes sense. Sure. Sure it it reflects it

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.030
It's something what's the attitude? I'm looking for it reminds me a little bit of

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.710
some of the things that sing a talks about in the fifth discipline about the learning organization and how and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.950
It all makes sense to me, but I'm trying to figure out where you're going with this

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.050
So what the way I capture this quote in any simpler way is essentially

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.740
people are thinking change is the problem and the problem is

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.780
When the change occurs you have people feeling

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.600
trapped

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.040
That's the problem is that they feel trapped. They don't understand how

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.120
They're going to provide value in this new world

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.500
But Alan wants is that a communication issue, you know, absolutely it is

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.040
Absolutely it is and that's the point what it was the point that that I would want to get across on this one is

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.240
That the best way leads can really help their folks is to say

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.230
your

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:30.990
Sense of entrapment is in your head and help them to move through that as fast as

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.750
Possible. There are more changes coming

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.910
Right as Alan and I have hinted to this and they you know

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.130
several podcasts one of the changes

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.910
My team is undergoing this. There is another major

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.510
Division undergoing this change and

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.630
I'll be a bit hyperbolic stick at the end of this change. I

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:02.230
Firmly believe the following things will occur. Okay. Number one world piece test

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.900
Will be gone

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.420
Number two. Oh, no. No, wait, not the test is dead speech. No. Yeah, we'll go back to that later

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.260
All right. Go ahead. Yeah. No, I actually so one of my

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.500
more popular

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.700
Block posts was there's no hope in test and I'm actually very tempted to write

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.840
You know what at this point in time? There is no hope for test now

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.180
Let's let's pause there a moment because I think that

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.340
There are a lot of wrong ways to interpret that statement

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.700
and I think we talk about the test activity versus the role, but what comes down to is

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.150
the the need for a

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:49.630
Separate team to throw stuff over the wall to is getting in the way of

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.900
Creativity and quick software development. It doesn't mean and the the point I want to get to is think what a lot of teams move

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.220
This direction they freak out because they think that oh my gosh now everybody has to do everything

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.980
And that is if you think that you will indeed fail. Yeah, absolutely horrible

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.380
It's everybody doesn't do everything you still have generalizing specialists

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:18.580
Who and you have a team that you jigsaw together you guys can't see it, but I roll my eyes every time he says that

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:26.660
Because you prefer I would say specializing generalists. Yeah, it doesn't matter we we need it's just really what we need

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.000
Really what we need is we need teams that

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.530
Understand that and build towards the value of diverse strengths. Yes

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.850
Let's just say that let's we need a diverse team

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:46.030
Every if you try and build a team where everybody does everything well everyone will write code and then they'll test it then they'll deploy

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:52.010
It and they'll test it in production. They'll analyze the data. Everyone does that that is BS total BS

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.290
You need people to do all those things some people can do all of them

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:02.290
It would probably isn't in their best interest to try and do all of them because then they're in the multi-tasking

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.010
Makes you stupid camp if you leverage your strengths and maybe you know

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.810
Someone's really good at all of that stuff, which means great. They can fill in anywhere

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:18.010
But I believe and we've talked about our you know our team principles before you your

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.570
Best shot at building a great team is to have

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.820
Have a team where people can everyone on the team can you know play to their passions?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.540
Absolutely, and then you know, I also firmly believe and there's

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.860
Again, I refer back to the l'angione book on I'm tying

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.120
Organizational health to product quality that if you build a great team, you're gonna make great software

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.730
Yes, let me let me continue on with you can try. Yes. I know I will try

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:52.610
Alright, the other thing and again, I'm being hyper or hyper ballistic on on purpose

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.130
But I also believe the PM role is gone

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:04.850
The PM's will shift into more of a role of product planning, which is much more along the lines of planning out the future

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.010
not necessarily

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:14.430
Managing the present so their their role will be much more around exploring world opportunities

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.950
Coming up with innovative ideas that can be tested

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.830
What's your timeline for this this sort of move?

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.290
this is gonna happen the

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.920
The beginnings of this will absolutely happen in our company in the next quarter. I

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.610
Can see that I know that we have I could probably

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:45.890
About labeling anyone. I know there's some flattening and some some combining going on some teams of Microsoft and some reduction in the number of

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.210
PM's on those teams. So and

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.890
For the record, I love it

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.900
next

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.610
leads

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.090
Will be gone

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.090
Also, I also have seen examples of that

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:09.450
So and the teams I've talked to like engineering director some engineering managers each of those with you know, 12 to 16 directs

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.740
right

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.740
again like it

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.640
You will also like the next two. All right the functional. It's so sorry. I just need a moment

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.610
Deep breath Brent's getting me a little a little excited here. All right, go on

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.290
next

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.770
The functional model will be gone

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.780
Doesn't it go away I talked more about that because I thought that's the functional model

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.420
I don't know if this translates worldwide

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.020
with within the

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.100
Corporation one of those Microsoft we have we not only have separated

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360
sort of activities into

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.160
distinct human roles

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.360
But we also have constructed an entire management chain around it

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.120
So we have director of tests we have director of development. We have director of PM

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:12.040
And what what that ends up doing is it it sort of maximizes the number of people who have to say yes before the product can

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.040
ship that model is gone

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.980
Hallelujah and

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:23.500
I know you will mourn this last one but actually pause there because I don't get how that's different from

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.220
what we've talked about above when we start flattening orgs and

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:35.580
Eliminate disciplines what why is it something separate at the functional? It's not different. It's

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.700
It's a different way of looking at the same thing. Okay, so some people are gonna view this as oh my gosh test is gone

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.540
How can you say that? Well another consequence is that no so the whole

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.780
Separation of disciplines is gone

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.380
Let me let me pause for the last yeah because that flattening is gonna scare people to from from two sides

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.300
Before you go all right because Brinson charge yes

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.920
Command and control

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.840
Will be gone. Yeah, and you've already mentioned it and what will happen. These are all the same thing

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.800
This is not five step things like it's not it's one little tweak BAM. They're gone

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:24.710
It's essentially one little tweak BAM. They're gone except for all the culture the we have like legacy culture the cultural ramifications

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.350
and when I mean the command and control will be gone is

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.110
We will have such a high span of control that

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.230
People who who used to thrive and believe that they could micromanage anything

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:45.380
That they those folks will not scale now that is an important change because the the leaders in charge

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.860
They're going to have to figure out how to train

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.380
how to train individuals to lead themselves and

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.820
From my experience having gone through this a couple of times

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.140
That is going to be a big loss to a lot of ICs

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.580
So Brent just gave me I was about to interrupt he'd be like the finger like no

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:14.500
Not done yet. I'm almost done. Are you done now? You may go so now I forgot my point damn it

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.050
I like all this and I think there's a lot of reasons people to freak out but for

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:26.290
Anyone worth their salt no worries because the things I like about this are is

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:33.430
You know Peter Drucker 20 years ago said, you know knowledge workers like we are today can't be managed micromanage

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.710
Can't be told what to do all the time

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.590
We need to have that creativity to figure out what to do. That's all absolutely true in the way we work

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.730
when you have a flatter org structure you have

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:49.990
Couple couple things come out of that one are it's a couple fears rise out of that one is the managers going

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.990
Well, there's two manager fears two types of managers that have fears there

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.110
The first manager is the one who's in charge of the team of 16, which may go

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.030
Oh, I don't know how to manage just many people

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.270
How do I get 16 one-on-ones on my calendar every week and the answer is you don't?

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.990
And thing is you don't manage your team. You coach them you mentor them

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.830
You guide them you give you you track you keep track of what they're doing, but you don't

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.710
Manage them you are a lot closer to give them the framework

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:27.190
They need to work in you make sure that you over communicate your total clarity on what you expect them to do

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.750
and then you get out of their way and then

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.730
Let them self organize to figure out they can figure out what to do that ties into the other lead

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.810
I'm gonna come back to in a second then the IC is like well

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:46.610
Now I can never be a lead because it's so I can either be an IC or I can be this engineering manager nothing in between

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:55.020
It's like well, you know dub dub dub, but the difference is is that I'm not certain how to translate dubba dubba dub

00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:01.340
Dubba dubba dubba is oh, I think it's this it's I'll show Brent in sign language

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.020
Yeah, right now Alan is saying bring your number one

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.660
Yes, yes, indeed so

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.100
The role of the lead at Microsoft today is sort of a technical lead role plus a lot of meetings

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.660
kind of an ineffective use of a lead in many cases when you have a team of

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.620
You know, you have like 16 people 15 people

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.220
You're not all working on the exact same thing again. Microsoft is also very married to the idea of

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.300
Of a team represents a functional part of the product

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:37.380
So the org structure is the product and it's it doesn't guess what?

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.540
No reverb for this but it doesn't have to be that way. There's a little secret tip. I might have a team of

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.510
dozen people 15 people and

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.390
For this iteration boy, we really need to get graphics performance working, you know

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.790
And I'm kind of that's my that's my area of expertise

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.270
I kind of become the virtual lead for that part little little the go-to guy

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.230
I make sure I get the right people together when we figure it out and we get stuff done and it's fantastic

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.230
And that's that's your lead opportunity

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.830
And you do enough of those and maybe you're the next guideline for the engineering manager

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.390
But if that's the direction you want to go, but we don't need as many

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:18.830
Managers in place to do that stuff. We need there's lots and lots and lots of opportunities for leadership. Mm-hmm

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.470
that need to occur and

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:27.150
Yet another tangent before I go back to the other type of manager who's going to have a worry here is that you know

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.630
I think it's interesting that people are getting leads are getting value on

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.830
Kind of how to lead through change from Brent and I one thing maybe not clear to the listeners

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.500
Outside of Microsoft maybe some of those even inside of Microsoft is Brent is a manager of people

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.820
I am today at least

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:52.380
Alan me I'm not I don't manage people. Alan is a voider and a voider of a

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.100
voider

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.460
And I think it's because

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.780
But for me, it's not I don't think it's definitely because in this sort of organization

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.260
I think I'll probably still be an IC

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.420
I could be

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:12.020
I have nothing against management. I could be a manager in some other type of organization, but Microsoft

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.080
management

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080
unfortunately generally means

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.500
Just having a lot more meetings

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.860
So one of the things that I would also say is while Alan isn't a manager and I am

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.820
I would say one thing that we have in common is we're both very passionate around

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:37.380
Leadership Alan views his role as being highly more effective in leading others in an IC role. Whereas I view

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.940
My ability to apply leadership a lot more effective when I have people underneath me

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.420
Yeah, and that's that's totally fine

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.420
anyway, so so

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.380
Blah blah blah rewindage on top the stack is the other kind of manager and this is the one

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.100
That I have a message for so okay. There's engineering managers

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.700
And then there's a bunch of ic's and guess what happens?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.740
It's a lot of managers who no longer have manager jobs when you make this sort of move

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.860
It's like oh, but uh, but uh, how do you translate that?

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.050
I translated equivalently to the last one. All right, maybe boo hoo

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.250
The answer there is um, uh, I want to say tough

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.730
But that's probably a little bit too harsh buck up buttercup

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.250
Yeah, it's it's like being a lead or a manager isn't some special right you've earned

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.560
you know you need you

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.400
Maybe you're capable of being an engineering manager and there isn't a job opening for you. Mm-hmm

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.200
Maybe and babe, but if you're a it's not like just because you're a lead you're incapable of doing that ic role and also

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.680
If you are in the ic role and you are and you were a former lead and you're not the one stepping up to be that

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:57.280
Technical lead and and help help that team self organize and form those problems. My question is why were you ever a lead in first place?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.260
So let me carry on from what alan was just saying so he he made a distinction between leaders and managers

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.780
Okay, so this I guess I did it indirectly. Yeah in

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.540
in

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.900
My next set of words for lack of a better word

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.900
I want to address the leaders who listen to us when I say leaders

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.300
These are people who are focused on doing the right thing for the business and their team

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.940
Um to some degree

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:31.260
Ignoring the consequences to themselves. Okay, there are a bunch of leaders leaders out right now

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.700
That are listening to us and these are the guys who I think are giving us the feedback that we're adding value to their lives

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.190
this change to some degree

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.490
Will occur in the next quarter

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:50.900
Okay guys, there's a sense of urgency i'm i'm gonna miss most of the next quarter. Yeah, he's he's hopping the

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.620
devons

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.620
anyway, so

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.380
What I want you guys to think through

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.270
now

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.790
Is how to be proactive on this when this change occurs?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.900
Your team's going to freak out

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.940
Okay

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.500
There's two ways of thinking of this problem. Number one. How do I calm them down?

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.700
Or number two, which I think is better

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.060
How do I get them to understand that all change is an opportunity?

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.180
And help them to capture that opportunity?

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.460
I think the answer there is in all of our previous podcasts where we talked about this

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:35.220
I mean every everything is in there buried in there. There's so i'll just go very quickly. Okay. All right

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.060
because this is um

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.740
Talk to the microphone not to me

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:45.700
My team my team is going through this now and so there's a series of conversations that i'm having all across the board. Okay

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.440
First and foremost when or if this team this this change hits your team

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.780
You need to understand

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.300
You will have roughly a week maybe two to act

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.530
That is not enough time. Then the zombies come what happens? No

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.320
What will will what will end up happening with with ic's?

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.420
Those who recognize it's an opportunity and act

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.700
will

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.580
will

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.940
Increase the probability that they land in the position

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.180
That they are looking for

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.340
Those who are reeling from the loss of say a command and control structure those waiting for the managers decide their fate

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.020
Okay

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.120
they will be placed

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.200
uh in positions that their management view is

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.960
Appropriate based on what their management has visibility to

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.390
first thing leads

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.870
What you need to do is find a way

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.030
to get these the particularly the the ones who are emotional

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:56.190
Is need to listen and get them through that emotional stage as fast as possible one of the messages i've been saying

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:03.310
Hey, I see that you have an impact. May I recommend that you schedule and your um

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.630
your cryfest

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.750
Two to three months from now because you do not have time for that today

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.470
Yeah, that's a good way to put that that's gonna um, that's gonna work out really well

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.990
It yeah, it's worked. It's actually worked rather well. There's no crying in engineering

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.430
You can cry if you want to I don't recommend that as a strategy because you don't have time for it

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.910
The second thing it's my org change. You can cry if you want to wasn't that a song in the 50s?

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.990
I think something like that. All right, if

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.220
Those who who just don't have the capability of doing that then you do need to just listen

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:42.900
uh empathize with them understand their fears and and and have them feel

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.340
As if you got their back the second thing

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.580
What I tell people

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.580
Is then what you need to do

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.420
Is you say I need you to go look at the options. There's a whole bunch of options

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.140
Let's let's say like the worst case scenario

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.980
You're a test lead who's been doing a pm role

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.720
Right those people are heavily at risk

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.460
What I say what I tell people look at your available options

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.180
And find the things that you would be most passionate about

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.900
Start with your passion use it as an opportunity. Oh my gosh. This is something I would love to go do

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.100
second

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.800
figure out

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.000
What you already do well towards that passion

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.190
third

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:37.070
Figure out how those two things your passion and what you do. Well will add business value and then most importantly

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.590
Usually these messages will come out with the the new leaders that are are leading these new missions

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.550
Go proactively have that conversation and let that leader know

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:53.310
What you came to conclusion on your the last three things your passion what you do well

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.870
And how you'll use it to add business value

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:02.830
If you do that once this change hits hits you or or if you're a lead and you encourage your team to do the same thing

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:09.870
That will increase the probability that they will land in the team that solves all three of those problems

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.550
That is the best advice I can give you right now

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.560
It is important that you prepare for that

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.130
I'm done. Anything else you want to say we can go to mail back to no. No, we can't I think uh

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.530
Rather than force someone to listen to every single one of our podcasts to find the the answers there

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.490
I think you know to me the key there. Yep is to the quicker you could understand

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.170
why the change is happening and what's going to come out of it and then you can

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:44.930
communicate that and over communicate that and over clarify that to the people on your team the better off you're going to and give them a

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.530
Method by which they could learn what they don't know today

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.060
Yeah, and

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.580
And it's perfectly okay to be uncomfortable. I believe and i've I've shared this quote before from the heffers book

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:02.740
And my slightly paraphrased version which is leadership is disappointing people at a level they can tolerate

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.860
Yes, I like that quote. I love that quote. All right, I want to go on to mail bag number two mail bag number two

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.660
dun dun dun

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.340
So I i'm a little voice in the background number two

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.780
Yeah, yeah moving on

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:23.060
So there was a question that that ben asked me as well and I gave him my answer

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.460
Are we still on our ben or this ben affleck?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:33.470
Arben, okay. Good. Yeah, i'm nowhere close cool enough to to get questions from ben affleck. That's for sure

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.630
and given

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.830
Uh, go on given daredevil. I'm not really certain I would want to

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.510
um

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.950
All right. Here's a question i'm dropping on you allen. All right, okay

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.040
If you were opening a new job description

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.980
That tried to attract the right people to the type of organization we are heading to

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.770
What would be the key?

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.570
Four to five bullets you would be looking for

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:10.850
Consider that you may want different types of people and these bullets should try to attract from all of those types

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.960
Yeah, I don't need that many bullets. Okay, I believe in a probably the last one i'll ask

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.200
Somewhere down the bullet list is I want people who are passionate about learning

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.280
and to me that that

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.160
Because again, it's like I want people with five years of swift experience, you know, not going to happen

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.720
You know, i'm not going to go out, you know for a brand new language, for example, i'm not going to go out and hire

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.920
Um someone with experience in that but people with passion for learning and demonstrated experience in that I want problem solvers

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.400
Collaborate people that like working together

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.980
So if my bullet points are team player and collaborator

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.540
Uh passion for learning

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.240
fantastic problem solvers

00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:00.600
Um, so i'm gonna call you on this now because sure go ahead everything you've got listed. Mm-hmm is a generalist

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.500
So what would be the types of generalizing specialists?

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.780
So the last two bullet points

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:16.060
Buddy boy working together. You didn't tell me you didn't tell me those things are critical for me. Okay, if

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.580
If I get those people and they're all kobol programmers and you're telling me I got to build a web service i'm screwed

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:27.420
Great, um, so I need some expertise to help lead the team. You didn't tell me what product i'm building yet

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.020
It doesn't ah, it does matter because that's where my other two bullet points come from

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:42.890
I have to I have to troll for some expertise in the technology as well or a related technology where I know I can grow and

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.170
adapt them

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.970
But I gotta have those things those generalist things are the most are critical generalist

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:56.490
attributes now tell me about the product and just for example, let's say i'm gonna sell not shoes like zappos i'm like

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.570
Mapos i'm gonna sell maps

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.810
How about someone familiar with you know rest api's and you know, I I can

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.690
Might even go that specific amigo web development experience or something

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.650
Are there are there?

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.960
Consider the the world we're heading into

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.380
and and consider missing capabilities

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:25.070
That that we don't have in that world as a whole but but specialist type of capabilities

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:31.950
So some of the specialist capabilities we need are data sciencey stuff. Okay as we get a product out brand new product

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.150
I may bring them a little bit later. Maybe not. I don't know I need

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.310
uh

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.230
Architectural people who can design the product and figure out how it's gonna all work together

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.510
Versus a bunch of general sticking their stuff together with scotch tape

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.900
um, I need some people

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.560
Again, i'm gonna need people who are

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.150
Technically proficient or i've experienced in the areas of the

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.400
Gosh, the technology we're going to build on and maybe i've waited for the architect to be done on there

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.960
I think I have some ideas of what we're going to do

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.500
most people

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:11.420
Who have done, you know serious web development and web development doesn't mean you hack together some html for your grandma

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.820
So people people have done some serious web development

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.420
Are have done so in a variety of languages

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:23.790
It's interesting. So so your answer there was remarkably similar to mine

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.620
The the first one because you copied

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.340
I

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.500
Ah, whatever. I have it written down

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.940
First off one of the things that I said is that you said data sciencey stuff

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.740
And there's a there's a parallel that i've come to realize right now throughout the company. Everyone's trying to hire

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.220
data scientists like crazy

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.580
And even if they don't know what they are especially if they don't know. Can you spell math hired?

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.640
the the

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.080
And one of the things that i've had find or had to find myself explaining

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.760
Is what exactly a data science is but in a way of a metaphor i'm like if we think of

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.220
Data flow or data analytics or data insight

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.140
in in

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.340
in like a

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.020
developing a new product

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:22.460
Okay, I I tell them you should think of a data scientist like a dev architect. Okay, we don't need 20 of those on a team

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:30.760
But there is another role where we do need a bunch of them and those are called data analysts. Uh-huh

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.720
Right. So what I think that's and to interrupt

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.680
Great insight and a piece that I think

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.320
Too many teams at least here have missed. Yes. All right, go on

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.640
We do need data science guys

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.360
Just like we need dev architects whose role it is to understand the system end to end

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.280
And help train up the developers. Mm-hmm. We need data science guys

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.960
Who can do the same and help train up the data analysts?

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.800
I I totally agree and i'm saying that's one of the things that I know you have farther to go

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.840
But one of the things has been pushing my buttons a lot

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.880
Um with some teams i've worked with here at microsoft is the sort of over indexing on

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.800
Everybody must be deep data scientists and no because so much what we want to know is just data analysis

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:22.060
Business intelligence we need some people who actually get how to derive insights properly

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.720
I'm so worried that these half equipped people will use

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.080
A little bit of knowledge about you know beige and analysis statistics to make some

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:39.000
Totally screwed up correlations. Mm-hmm and and and dig us a hole. I'm really really worried about that

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.160
I want people who know what they're doing to do that

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.920
A whole bunch of other people can analyze and generate data and figure stuff out, but I want to I want to

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.880
I would prefer

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.520
To let the people who actually really know what they're doing make some of those more

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:01.480
And what I would involve choices I hear what you're saying and what I would actually argue is that we need both

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.040
No, we need those people that you're afraid of but we need them guided by someone who knows what they're doing

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.040
Yes, my word and the worry is that the people who i'm afraid of

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.200
Uh will be will not be guided and they'll be the ones that we believe

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.330
Yes, and that will absolutely happen

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.210
And will insert boom explosion sound effect here

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.320
Can you do that later? I don't have one. I gotta find the royalty free sound effect library

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.960
The other thing I said

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.080
was business innovators

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.320
people who who

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.080
understand

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.040
The possible markets and and can come up with new ideas for us to explore

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.560
We've talked before about um, we will have needs for doing fighting

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.320
But what we also need is a good set of people

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.200
to to really help direct

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.420
The or constrain what we flight great. I'm on sqlbi

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.700
Uh, i'm i'm on the business intelligence team

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:12.780
Right someone comes down and says hey what we really should do is flight an experiment to help cat groomers

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.660
Why?

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.100
Right something someone that can that can look at the market as a whole

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.860
generate ideas around how we could

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.410
Do leapfrog innovation?

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.890
One of the challenges with with data science

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:36.290
On its own data science is very good at looking at the data we have right now and helping us to evolve

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.850
But to get those really breakthrough things you still need people

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.700
the the

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.900
model

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.860
Model building this is the idea of generating

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:56.180
Data flows to to help decision making model building is really a strong combination of art and science

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:02.900
Which by the way is something test is very good at this is how we've done a lot of our test automation in the past

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.700
What do we think is the most important?

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:12.100
Um, there's an art around communication. I think we're well built for this the last one. I think is

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:17.860
Similar to what you were talking about with the system architectures or the system architects. Okay

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.860
I actually view it as what we need is system thinkers

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
yeah, I believe and

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:31.060
We need them to have the ability to to capture what they observe in terms of the system

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.860
And automate improvements around it

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.320
I think actually you alan when you say you're a specialist in process

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.200
Actually, I think you're one of these guys that i'm talking about

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.840
I stunned alan

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:51.520
I i'm processing go on brent. So for for an example, uh, I had a conversation just this last week around

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.400
Alerting and monitoring right everyone knows we need alerting to monitoring this service. Okay

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.950
But what no one knows is what the value is of it

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.740
and

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.490
I explained

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.770
Let's say two years from now the value of this alerting to monitoring two years from now is that

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.670
When a dev does a check-in

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:20.910
Because we go straight to prod and in that future world. They do a check-in five minutes later. It's in prod

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.950
five minutes later

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.630
We have a system that that detected that they have a a

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:35.950
That that check-in that exact check-in has a negative customer impact and there's a uh mail notification. It is sent to that

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:43.390
Developer within five minutes of of that check-in saying you have an impact. Here's the log traces

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.510
Investigate what the right option is to do i'm disappointed. We have to use email for that but

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.680
But i'll live so I want a couple things

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.440
I don't know what it is, but I want to be less than five minutes and you didn't mention it

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.280
But is it automatic? I don't want just a notification. I want it chucked out of there

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.920
But understand what I did there

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.400
Right first off to me. That's maybe i'm just uh in a different

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.600
World but to me that's just bread and butter. Of course, that's what you want to do

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.120
No, but that's because you're a systems thinker and it's not bread and butter others don't think this way screw all you guys

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.280
The the what we did there is we said

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.320
How does the system work and what is the value we're trying to capture from it?

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.500
Now let's go automate and capture that value

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.960
Yeah, and I I guess I can see that oftentimes the solution is let's go automate. We'll figure out what the value is later

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.170
I

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.850
You're you're not saying that you support that model. No, no, okay. No

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.230
um

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.230
All if we want to write some automation

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.900
the

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.660
And then there's one last

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.260
We have one last question. Do we have time for it? I think so. You want to move on to it?

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:57.300
Are you okay? Are you done? Yeah about that? So if we have time there's an there's an idea that i'm going to do that

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.820
I'll at all. All right, we we'll see we'll see. So, um

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.790
Another one from my personal melbec. I someone emailed me and said hey alan

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:13.970
Our team's doing kind of agile stuff and i'm not sure how do we measure accountability on an agile team?

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.470
So brent i'm gonna ask you so

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:22.670
And I had an answer and i'm not going to give you my answer yet, but i'm gonna ask you how do you?

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.170
What what does the accountability model look like on an agile team?

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:34.670
Did you get a sense of what they want that team to be accountable for in the past? The team has been accountable for?

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.750
uh

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.750
Hold you know meeting their estimates

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.990
Uh getting you know, do anything's out on time and of of some level of quality is this coming from our uh,

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.470
now famous

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.630
Your uh

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:56.430
Manager friend the the dev manager friend who has come up before in this podcast. Yes. So this is from his manager actually. Okay

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.710
so

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.030
in an agile team

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:06.990
The only thing of value to hold the agile team accountable for

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.790
Is the production of value?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.440
In other words, a lot of teams are like hey, I want this task done on this time

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:22.880
So you're saying the team so I get that so then is the team have a group accountability or is there individual accountability as well?

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.560
uh

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.320
So we've talked about and it's gotten to a point where i'm starting to think

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.880
How to rephrase this the term self-organizing self-organizing. Okay

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.460
Unfortunately, that's starting to become cliche and inactionable

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.430
right what what I

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:47.390
Yes, what I have found is to be the most successful thing to do is is to lay down to the team

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.470
guys

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.470
You guys need to be accountable

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.150
for

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.230
This value statement. Let's say

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.060
I don't I don't care

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:04.140
But I need the architecture of this system to be hand to be able to handle another 20 percent

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.940
throughput in the next month because

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.940
we know

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.060
uh

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.540
Load is going to increase in that time frame. Okay

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:19.620
That's the value proposition. I want this thing to be able to handle another 20 percent of load in that time frame

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.850
And then you hold that team accountable

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.810
Let them figure out how they're going to achieve that goal

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.690
if you if you do personal accountability

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.480
um

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.980
then

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.980
You'll have individuals who are

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.820
achieving what they got done

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.460
And other individuals achieving what they got done, but when we try to integrate that

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.180
the value proposition that you're going for

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.700
um

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.890
Won't be delivered

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.890
What you want them to go after what?

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:54.450
What is the value we want to capture?

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.860
the

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.140
You don't look happy with no, no go on go on i'll have my turn. Okay

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.360
um

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.160
There is a timeliness factor to that. Of course, you can't you can't allow them to to

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.400
Take that one 20 percent goal and take six months to do it

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.420
um

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.420
but if it if it takes

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.700
two days longer

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:23.180
To to solidify then in my humble opinion, that's just fine

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:28.610
Yeah, to me that answer is I get where you're coming from and I get all that I think that

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.690
uh

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.770
Probably not the answer they were looking for

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.930
meaning that

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.730
uh

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:41.490
If you could say if everyone's accountable then no one's accountable so team accountability is tough

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:47.970
So my answer was and i'll stand i'll stand by this. I believe this especially in the context of our discussion before

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.970
is that

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:53.010
Yes, everything brent said is true. You want to hold the team?

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.490
The team i'm you're accountable for you know getting this is for value stream

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.730
We expected this to get done this iteration

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.210
We affected these items to get done off the con bond board in this amount of time. Um, you know

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.370
We're gonna kind of hold the team accountable

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:09.970
But if they don't make it it's not like we're gonna penalize the team put them in the penalty box

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:12.210
But as far as individual accountability

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.970
I put that on the manager of the team a man

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:21.250
I don't care if it's if you have four people working for you or 16 as a manager of a team of people

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:22.610
I know

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:26.930
Who has pulled their weight who has not pulled their weight and had a bad iteration?

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:32.210
Who is kicking butt for each iteration that may change as you know for iteration iteration?

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:41.410
But I know if if as a manager, I don't know how everybody in my team has performed over the last iteration or you know

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.970
These items on the con bond board. I'm a crummy manager

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.050
I need to know that stuff

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:53.250
I need to know how my team's doing and sometimes they're going to sandbag me or whatever and as far as estimates go

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:58.450
And I brought these up just in the context of the conversation. I said if someone gets their estimates wrong, you know

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.690
That's a starting point for a conversation

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.850
Um, if you start holding and again, if you start holding people accountable for their estimates

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.730
They're going to start mucking with the values until they get them, right?

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:13.010
But let you want to see a couple things with estimates you want to see some improvement over time

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.410
People should get better at them over time

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.090
Um, and if somebody's way off you have a conversation about it

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.530
It may be

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:26.770
That their estimate was way off because they screwed off and watched world cup soccer all day instead of doing their job

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.840
Or it may be that once they actually looked into the work item

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.320
There was a whole can of worms there that no one could have anticipated, you know

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.620
two completely different ways to get to the same

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.060
uh the same end so I want to use a

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.420
really invalid estimate or a

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.440
Estimate that was missed by a lot as a starting point for a conversation

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.980
Not as a single point of accountability

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.140
And then there's code quality and I want to make sure what you delivered was what you know

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.420
Was it as good as our standards or better?

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.900
Um collaboration I look for like for team members who are helping each other out

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:10.900
I want people doing code reviews for each other. I want people, you know, helping each other out in examples of that and as a manager

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.180
I have those things

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.140
So all those things I want to hold individuals accountable and make sure I know that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.860
But i'm not going to look at a single point like did you get done when you said you would check?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:26.100
No, no check plus minus. That's just stupid. There's a couple of things

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:27.780
that uh

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:33.060
In terms of what you said that in the spirit of it. I agree in terms of how you would deploy it. I don't

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.020
The the first thing like the question you asked me is how do you hold a team accountable?

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.060
Honestly, my answer is is you don't what you do is you figure out

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.500
How to get the team to hold themselves accountable?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.480
Any process that says it's my job to hold others accountable. Okay

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.360
That's reinvigorating the command and control structure. I'm not saying you you completely misunderstood. No, no, let me finish

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.920
Okay, I didn't I did not completely misunderstood

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.480
Probably it so when I spin and it goes to the first topic

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.800
How do how do you help leads to scale in this world where there's going to be 10 to 15?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.520
Plus reports that they have

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.720
Right. Um, you act like it's a big deal. It's whatever

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.400
If honestly says the guy who runs screaming every time he's in a manager role

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.440
If you're not capable of running it if you don't you can't see how easy not easy

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.440
But if you can't see the value and having a team that size and you're afraid of it

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.160
Guess what? Don't be a manager get the hell out my my strategy when it comes to my team

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.840
is

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.680
Look what we need to do is deliver the most business value as fast as possible learning is important. Yay

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.360
um

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.320
and

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.760
My accountability that that I expect of that team

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.080
Is to constantly accelerate that goal

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.640
How do how do we provide the most?

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.800
So let's step no, no, no, let's step out of the agile stream stuff for a minute

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.080
There is also the people management part and you have to know

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.440
You want to take your top performers and celebrate those victors?

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.240
Everyone goes what these guys are doing is great do more of this stuff

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:19.360
Then you want to be able to non-publicly dive in on those lower performers for whatever reason and give them the coaching they need

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:26.720
There's that's the part i'm talking about here not about the value stream, but that's not an accountability. That's an identification program that well, it's both

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.160
It I can see why you would say that like how do I identify those folks?

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.160
How do I understand what they're doing wrong?

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.000
What they're doing wrong is more often than not a behavior thing and trying to deliver some stupid metric that says well

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
You didn't do 10 widgets

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.520
I don't want it to be a metric. I want to be a purely a management activity to know who on the team is

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:59.200
Doing you know really well and and celebrating that public least people can noted you more that and knowing where I need to do coaching

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.840
That is you do that through personal and hubeid interaction not through metrics

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.920
You do and and if you if you do it, right you don't

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.960
You as a manager don't need to be the one doing it

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.860
So I talked last or you well you as a manager should be observing it. Yes. Yeah, absolutely

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.560
And you need to know the point is you need to know what's going on facilitating

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.780
The the breakthrough on these type of bottlenecks

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:30.220
So the the person that you're identifying in my way of thinking they're a bottleneck to the team process

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:37.340
And it's my job to to help identify those bottlenecks and remove them from the system using

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:45.900
Whatever tool in my tool bag and I am willing to use any tool in my tool bag including you're no longer part of my system

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.050
But one of the better ways of of doing this is

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.240
Make it transparent

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.840
So I talked about value stream maps if we do a value stream map on something that's that last time

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.720
If we do a value stream map on something critical for the the team's success the the the value the team's trying to capture

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.280
And we realize hey, there was a two two week delay because this guy was goofing off

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.300
right

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:23.620
It doesn't stand too long when when you have that discussion as a team and that guy and everyone else on the team

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.700
Is staring at the two-week delay?

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:30.660
Yes, but there's it may just be there a goofing off. They could have had family problems

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.700
They could have been you know a whole bunch that could be on the wrong job

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.820
When I take the cobalt programmer and put him on the rest service and he goes blah blah blah blah blah blah

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.860
I you know, I did a bad job as a manager. I didn't go fix that

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:51.020
But then that's still not the issue of how do I hold individuals accountable? That's how do I hold myself accountable?

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.460
Sure

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.460
All right, brent you're just

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.860
All right, we better stop

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.900
More crap. There's one other thing that I want to there's always one other thing. Okay

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:10.670
so you and I have talked many a time about the need for knowledge sharing and and

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.870
increasing the rate in which people learn

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.150
What they don't know they don't know

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:22.830
Okay, and we've talked about one of our competitors who do status reports every friday and I have actually

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:24.830
searchable

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:32.030
So the whole company yes, and I have been talking to others around this for a long time and it wasn't until yesterday with I realized

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.590
Holy crap. What am I waiting for?

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.230
So I am going to do

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:42.190
A new thing on my team. I call them individual retrospective reports

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.990
very soon

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:49.710
Me and my team what we will be doing is we will be posting to a public yammer group

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.060
um

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.460
These individual retrospective reports and the intent of the report is not a status report

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:02.300
The intent of the report is to communicate publicly on an individual basis. What are they doing?

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.580
Where they can use help from others and where they think they might be able to help others?

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.020
and the entire intent of this thing is to

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:19.220
Increase the odds that someone who can help us and someone we can help can find us

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:24.930
And we're gonna I'm gonna do a competition on my team to see who can come up with the right format

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:28.130
that can keep that report down to 15 minutes and

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:31.970
Attract the most of that communication. All right

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:37.090
Well, we'll visit that more in the future when we have time to talk about it

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:40.370
I would love to hear your initial thought though. Well, no time so

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:48.860
That'll be in episode eight put it on the backlog there bj. All right then. All right, everybody. I'm alan

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.680
I'm brent and we'll see you later. Thank you. Bye
